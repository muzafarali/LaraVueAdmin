<span>Britain\'s defense secretary has declared that the once war-torn southern Iraqi city of Basra is now a "transformed city."<br><br>Des
Browne, who made an unannounced visit to Basra on Thursday, comes two 
months after Iraq\'s government launched a recent offensive in the 
largely Shiite city against what they call criminal elements.<br><br>A 
British military news release said Browne "engaged with local residents"
as he talk a stroll in a neighborhood. He saw "market stalls, craftsmen
and shoppers" in what was a "previously hazardous area."<br><br>"As I 
walked through Basra\'s streets today, chatting to people, it was clear 
to everyone that Basra is a transformed city. I felt an enormous sense 
of pride in what the Iraqi forces have achieved with our help," Browne 
said, according to the news release.<br><br>"Mid-afternoon I sat in a 
Basra street cafe and had a cup of tea with General Mohammed Juwad 
Huwaidi, commander of the Iraqi forces in Basra. All around us were the 
signs of a city returning to normality -- shop keepers working away, 
women walking around wearing head scarves and children playing on their 
bikes."<br><br>Maj. Tom Holloway, the British military spokesman, told 
CNN on Friday that Browne discussed security plans with British 
commanders and met with local Iraqi military officials during the 
three-hour visit.<br><br>British troops had been based in Basra city 
since the Iraq war began in 2003. The country handed over security 
control to Iraqis late last year, but still maintains a presence in 
Basra province.<br><br>The defense ministry says there are 4,000 British
troops in southern Iraq, and they are focused on training and mentoring
and "carry out tasks in support of the coalition."<br><br>Iraqi Prime 
Minister Nuri al-Maliki in late March launched the offensive targeting 
an outlaw element that had been holding sway in city neighborhoods.<br><br>Many
observers believe the fighting reflected the country\'s intra-Shiite 
rivalries. Much of the fighting pitted Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr\'s 
Mehdi Army militia against the government security forces dominated by 
members of a rival Shiite group, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.<br><br>The
offensive sparked fighting in other Shiite towns and in Baghdad\'s 
predominantly Sadr City, where troops fought Shiite militants until a 
cease-fire was recently forged.<br><br>Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S.
military official in Iraq, mentioned the Basra offensive during 
testimony on Thursday at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee.<br><br>He said the operation -- which was criticized for its 
hasty planning and initially seen by some observers as a government 
failure -- "did have a shaky start." The Senate hearing was over his 
nomination to head U.S. Central Command.<br><br>Petraeus said the operation has since had "enormous progress that has produced very positive tactical and strategic results."<br><br>"The
tactical results are the return of control to legitimate security 
forces in Basra, something for which the .... people of that city and 
province are quite grateful and they\'re pleased about."<br><br>Browne said it was his ninth visit to Basra over the past two years.<br><br>"In that time there have been highs and there have been lows. I have seen progress and I have seen that progress stall.<br><br><br>"But
never have I seen the Iraqi army operating with such confidence and 
enjoying such support from the local people. This would not have been 
possible without the hard work of the British military," he said.</span>

reprimanded by his commanding general, dismissed from his regiment and

<span>Tornadoes swept through the Midwest on Sunday, killing seven people in Iowa and a toddler in Minnesota.<br><br>A
tornado touched down in the north-central Iowa town of Parkersburg at 
about 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), killing five before moving 10 miles east to 
New Hartford, where two others died in the storm, said Troy Price, a 
spokesman for Gov. Chet Culver.<br><br>Spotters also reported a tornado 
near Dunkerton -- about 40 miles east of Parkersburg -- that they said 
caused considerable damage and flung debris as the storm moved at 23 
miles per hour. Marble-sized hail fell over Waterloo, where authorities 
reported significant damage to homes, trees and power lines.<br><br>"Early
reports indicate that these communities have suffered severe and 
widespread damage, and I plan to visit the region very soon to offer my 
support to those affected," Culver said in a prepared statement. He 
declared disaster areas in three counties.<br><br>Meanwhile, a Minnesota
twister killed a 2-year-old child and seriously injured nine other 
people -- including another child -- in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul.<br><br>The
tornado struck Hugo, about 25 miles north of the Twin Cities, 
destroying 50 homes and damaging another 150, city manager Mike Ericson 
told CNN.<br><br>The National Weather Service confirmed the tornado in 
Hugo that touched down just after 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), and 
authorities reported twisters in nearby Coon Rapids and Blain.<br><br>Video
from the scene showed chairs, televisions, shingles and other debris 
tossed into the streets of the 11,500-population Hugo. Nickel-sized hail
and larger pelted the suburb.<br><br>Sgt. Rick Boone of the Coon Rapids
Police Department said a twister cut through the middle of town, 
downing trees and causing minor damage to several homes. No fatalities 
or injuries were immediately reported.<br><br>Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty planned to meet with local authorities Monday afternoon and tour the affected areas.<br><br>Earlier
in the day, authorities in Moore County, Texas, reported sightings of 
three twisters, though details were not immediately available.<br><br>On
Saturday, tornadoes formed over northern Oklahoma, skipping across the 
rural landscape and severely damaging a hog farm about an hour northwest
of Oklahoma City. There were no reports of injuries, officials said.<br><br>However,
two people were found dead in south-central Kansas on Saturday in a car
accident that authorities said was caused by a tornado.</span>

<span>The first pictures from NASA\'s Mars Phoenix Lander, which 
successfully touched down near Mars\' north pole Sunday, showed a pattern
of brown polygons as far as the camera could see.<br><br>"It\'s 
surprisingly close to what we expected and that\'s what surprises me 
most," said Peter Smith, the mission\'s principal investigator. "I 
expected a bigger surprise."<br><br>The landing on the Red Planet\'s 
arctic plains -- which ended a 296-day journey -- was right on target, a
feat NASA\'s Ed Weiler compared to landing a hole-in-one with a golf 
ball from 10,000 miles.<br><br>The landing -- dubbed the "seven minutes 
of terror" -- was a nerve-wracking experience for mission managers, who 
have witnessed the failure of similar missions.<br><br>In mission 
control at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, 
they celebrated the lander\'s much-anticipated entry.<br><br>"It was better than we could have imagined," Barry Goldstein, project manager for the Phoenix mission, told CNN.<br><br>The Phoenix\'s 90-day mission is to analyze the soils and permafrost of Mars\' arctic tundra for signs of past or present life.<br><br>The
lander is equipped with a robotic arm capable of scooping up ice and 
dirt to look for organic evidence that life once existed there, or even 
exists now.<br><br>"We are not going to be able to answer the final 
question of is there life on Mars," said principal investigator Peter 
Smith, an optical scientist with the University of Arizona. "We will 
take the next important step. We\'ll find out if there\'s organic material
associated with this ice in the polar regions. Ice is a preserver, and 
if there ever were organics on Mars and they got into that ice, they 
will still be there today."<br><br>The twin to the Mars Polar Lander 
spacecraft, Phoenix was supposed to travel to Mars in 2001 as the Mars 
Surveyor spacecraft. They were originally part of the "better, faster, 
cheaper" program, formulated by then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin to 
beef up planetary exploration on a lean budget.<br><br>But Polar 
malfunctioned during its descent into Mars\' atmosphere in 1999 and 
crashed. An investigation concluded that as many as a dozen design flaws
or malfunctions doomed the spacecraft.<br><br>The failure of that 
mission, as well as another spacecraft called the Mars Climate Orbiter 
the same year, led to NASA to put future missions on hold and rethink 
the "better, faster, cheaper" approach. Mars Surveyor went to the 
warehouse.<br><br>But all was not lost. In 2003, Smith proposed a plan 
to re-engineer the Mars Surveyor and fly it on a mission to look for 
signatures of life in the ice and dirt of Mars far North. Mars Phoenix, 
literally and figuratively, rose from the ashes of Surveyor.<br><br>Engineers
set to work, testing and retesting the onboard system to ferret out and
fix all the flaws they could find. iReport.com: Send your photos, video
of space.<br><br>"We always have to be scared to death," Goldstein 
said. "The minute we lose fear is the minute that we stop looking for 
the next problem."<br><br>The team was concerned about the Phoenix 
landing system. NASA had not successfully landed a probe on Mars using 
landing legs and stabilizing thrusters since the Viking missions in the 
late 1970s. The other three successful Mars landings -- Pathfinder in 
1997 and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004 -- used massive 
airbags that inflated around the landing craft just before landing to 
cushion the impact.<br><br>The Phoenix doesn\'t have airbags because the lander is too big and heavy for them to work properly.<br><br>Its
landing site was targeted for the far northern plains of Mars, near the
northern polar ice cap. Data from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft indicate 
large quantities of ice there, likely in the form of permafrost, either 
on the surface or just barely underground.<br><br>"Follow the water" has become the unifying theme of NASA\'s Mars exploration strategy.<br><br>In
2004, the rover Opportunity found evidence that a salty sea once lapped
the shores of an area near Mars\' equator called Meridiani Planum. 
Astrobiologists generally agree that it\'s best to look for life in wet 
places.</span>

<span>Sen. Barack Obama accused Sen. Hillary Clinton of stoking 
anger in Florida and Michigan over the Democratic Party\'s decision not 
to recognize the states\' primary votes.<br><br>"They weren\'t stirring it
up when they didn\'t need the delegates," he said. "Let\'s not sort of 
pretend that we don\'t know what\'s going on. This is, from their 
perspective, their last slender hope to make arguments about how they 
can win.<br><br>Obama, speaking to reporters on his campaign plane late 
Saturday, also took on Sen. John McCain\'s suggestion that Obama\'s lack 
of military service makes him unqualified to criticize him on veterans 
issues.<br><br>"I will cede to no one the ability to talk about veterans
issues," Obama said. "My grandfather was a veteran. Those veterans 
benefits helped my grandparents to raise my mother. I have veterans 
throughout the state of Illinois that I\'ve been fighting for since I 
came into the United States Senate."<br><br>Obama returned to his home 
base of Chicago, Illinois, Saturday night after a campaign swing through
in Puerto Rico, which holds its primary June 1, and spending three days
in Florida.<br><br>Obama said he wants a resolution of the controversy 
over the seating of the Florida and Michigan delegations so that they 
"feel that they\'ve been treated fairly and they\'re seated."<br><br>"I want to be looking at them when I\'m standing on the stage in Denver in August," Obama said.<br><br>He said the "anger will go away once it\'s resolved" and it will not be a deciding factor in the November general election.<br><br>"I
think the Democrats are going to be focused on who\'s going to stop the 
war, who\'s going to be making Supreme Court appointments, who\'s going to
have a serious energy policy, who\'s going to bring good jobs and good 
wages, who\'s going to continue the Bush tax cuts and who\'s going to give
a middle class tax cut," Obama said.<br><br>"The notion that the folks 
in Florida, who are trying to struggle with $4 gas and not being able to
get property insurance for their house during hurricane season, are 
going to be making a decision based on a political tempest that occurred
during a primary, I don\'t see it," he said.<br><br>Obama said he 
predicted a "substantive debate" with McCain during the general election
over veterans issues, especially if McCain continues to oppose the 
expansion of the GI Bill.<br><br>"John McCain will have to decide 
whether he thinks that the current level of benefits or the current 
performance of the VA is sufficient," Obama said.<br><br>After Obama 
took to the Senate floor last Thursday to criticize McCain\'s opposition 
to legislation, which passed by a 75-22 vote margin, McCain quickly 
responded that Obama was taking "cheap shots" on an issue that "he has 
less than zero understanding of."<br><br>"I will not accept from Sen. 
Obama, who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country 
in uniform, any lectures on my regard for those who did," McCain said in
a written statement.<br><br>Asked to respond Saturday, Obama said "the 
notion that somehow I can\'t speak out on behalf of veterans because of 
the fact that I didn\'t serve makes no sense whatsoever."<br><br>Obama 
said that he, and many others his age, did not serve in the military 
because the Vietnam War -- and the draft -- ended before he was of draft
age.<br><br>"Obviously, I revere our soldiers and want to make sure 
they are treated with honor and respect," he said. "I think the GI Bill 
is one way to do that. I hope that John McCain and George Bush decide 
they believe the same thing."<br><br>The updated version of the GI Bill,
which has now passed the Senate and House, proposes to essentially 
provide a full scholarship to in-state public universities for members 
of the military who have served for at least three years.<br><br>McCain 
supports enacting legislation to expand education benefits for veterans,
but he, as well as President Bush and much of the military brass, 
oppose this specific measure because they worry it will deplete 
retention rates among those currently serving in the military at a time 
when recruitment efforts are already struggling.</span>

<span>As president of the Pentagon Memorial Fund, Jim Laychak has been involved in nearly aspect of the project\'s planning.<br><br>The
only thing he has not done is visit the bench dedicated to his brother,
Dave Laychak, who died on September 11, 2001, when a passenger airplane
hit the Pentagon.<br><br>"I want to hold off and go and see his bench 
and touch his bench that day," said Laychak. "I wanted to save something
special for me personally on September 11 when we dedicate the 
memorial, so I can spend some time with it then."<br><br>Laychak is one 
of many looking forward to the dedication of the memorial, which is 
being built to honor the 184 people killed when American Airlines Flight
77 crashed into the Pentagon.<br><br>"This is hallowed ground for a lot
of the family members, and the essence of this place will be about 
them, those that we lost," Laychak said.<br><br>After more than five 
years of fundraising, the organizers are about $13 million short of 
their goal. They plan to have the memorial finished and dedicated on the
seventh anniversary of the attacks.<br><br>The park, which cost $22 
million to build, needs another $10 million in endowment funds to make 
sure it\'s always properly maintained. So far, the Pentagon Memorial Fund
has raised $19 million from sources as diverse as former Defense 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, NBA star [and Navy veteran] David Robinson 
and the government of Taiwan.<br><br>The focus of the memorial is 184 
cantilevered benches built over a pool of lighted water. Each bench is 
engraved on the end with the name of one of the 184 people who died on 
board Flight 77 or in the Pentagon that day.<br><br>The benches are 
arranged by age, with the bench of the youngest victim, 3-year-old Dana 
Falkenberg, in the far southeast corner and the bench honoring 
71-year-old John Yamnicky in the northwest corner.<br><br>For Wendy Ploger, whose father and stepmother died aboard Flight 77, the benches add special meaning to the memorial.<br><br>"I
don\'t know how to describe it, but it tells the story of what happened,
which is sort of what helps me to heal," said Ploger, whose relatives 
were on their honeymoon when they died.<br><br>The benches for the 59 
victims on board the plane are arranged so that someone reading the name
on the end of the bench will face the sky where the plane came from. 
The 125 benches for the victims inside the Pentagon face the opposite 
direction, so someone reading the name will look up and see the south 
facade of the Pentagon, where the jet hit that day.<br><br>"The way the 
bench is facing, my father\'s bench, if you read his name on the end of 
it, you are facing the same direction that the plane was flying [from] 
as it impacted the Pentagon," said Ploger, whose parents were originally
scheduled to take a different flight but changed their plans.<br><br>"At
first I felt a little strange sitting on it. But then, it\'s comfort and
it feels good and I feel like I\'m close to my loved one," she said.<br><br>Some
of the original plans have changed since construction started in June 
2006. Originally, the benches were to be made of aluminum. But aluminum

<span>Days of moist, cool weather helped firefighters get a handle 
on a destructive wildfire in the Santa Cruz Mountains that scorched 
3,900 acres and at least 29 homes.<br><br>Easing winds and lower 
temperatures helped keep the blaze from spreading and fire crews had the
blaze mostly contained early Monday, according to the California 
Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention.<br><br>"It\'s really not moving at all," said David Coursey, a department spokesman.<br><br>The
6-square-mile fire was expected to be fully surrounded by Tuesday, fire
officials said. The blaze still threatened 550 homes and 20 commercial 
buildings.<br><br>While some evacuees were let in on an hour-by-hour 
basis to survey the damage, hundreds of residents were told to stay away
following the outbreak of the fire in the mountainous region about 15 
miles south of San Jose.<br><br>Five firefighters have suffered minor injuries.<br><br>In
a community meeting at a church Sunday afternoon, residents eager to 
sleep in their own beds were given bad news. Officials said a quick turn
in weather could re-ignite the blaze, and that they would have to wait 
until Tuesday to return home.<br><br>Meanwhile, nearly 3,000 personnel 
worked to cut fire lines through centuries-old redwood forests as a 
swarm of helicopters and air tankers doused flames from the sky.<br><br>Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency for Santa Cruz and 
Santa Clara counties to allow access to state funds. The firefighting 
effort has cost $6.1 million so far, Coursey said.<br><br>Smoke from the
wildfire has left a haze over the San Francisco Bay area that was 
expected to linger through the Memorial Day weekend.<br><br>Investigators
are still probing the cause of the fire, which broke out just as the 
state\'s unofficial fire season got under way in mid-May. The blaze 
erupted following the state\'s driest two-month period on record.</span>

<span>Seven people died in tornadoes that blew through the 
Midwestern United States on Sunday, with six reported dead in Iowa and a
toddler in Minnesota, authorities said Monday.<br><br>Authorities in 
Iowa had reported that seven people died in Sunday\'s storm but lowered 
that total to six on Monday, said Bret Voorhees, a spokesman for the 
Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.<br><br>A 
tornado touched down at about 6 p.m. Sunday in the north-central Iowa 
town of Parkersburg before moving 10 miles east to New Hartford, 
Voorhees said.<br><br>Spotters also reported a tornado near Dunkerton --
about 40 miles east of Parkersburg -- that they said caused 
considerable damage and flung debris as the storm moved at 23 mph. 
Marble-size hail fell in Waterloo, where authorities reported 
significant damage to homes, trees and power lines.<br><br>"Early 
reports indicate that these communities have suffered severe and 
widespread damage, and I plan to visit the region very soon to offer my 
support to those affected," Iowa Gov. Chet Culver said in a statement. 
He declared disaster areas in three counties.<br><br>Meanwhile, a 
Minnesota twister killed a 2-year-old and seriously injured nine others 
-- including another child -- in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul.<br><br>The
tornado struck Hugo, about 25 miles north of the Twin Cities, 
destroying 50 homes and damaging another 150, city manager Mike Ericson 
said.<br><br>The National Weather Service confirmed the tornado in Hugo 
that touched down just after 5:30 p.m. Sunday, and authorities reported 
twisters in nearby Coon Rapids and Blaine.<br><br>Video footage from the
scene showed chairs, televisions, shingles and other debris tossed into
the streets of Hugo. Nickel-size hail and larger pelted the suburb.<br><br>Sgt.
Rick Boone of the Coon Rapids Police Department said a twister cut 
through the middle of town, downing trees and causing minor damage to 
several homes. No fatalities or injuries were immediately reported.<br><br>Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty planned to meet with local authorities Monday afternoon and tour the affected areas.<br><br>Also Sunday, authorities in Moore County, Texas, reported sightings of three twisters.<br><br>On
Saturday, tornadoes formed over northern Oklahoma, skipping across the 
rural landscape and severely damaging a hog farm about an hour northwest
of Oklahoma City. There were no reports of injuries, officials said.<br><br>However, two people were found dead Saturday in south-central Kansas in a car accident that authorities said a tornado caused.</span>

</div>


<span>Seventeen years after race riots left the streets of one New 
York City neighborhood bloodied, tensions are rising again there between
Orthodox Jews and blacks.<br><br>First, a black man was badly beaten. 
Weeks later, a Jewish teenager said he was attacked by two young blacks 
while riding his bicycle, and angry Jewish residents took to the streets
with signs saying "Jewish blood is not cheap!" and "Every Jew a .22."<br><br>And
along the way, the district attorney accused an Orthodox Jewish street 
patrol of vigilantism and compared the group to street gangs like the 
Bloods and Crips.<br><br>The strife has revived painful memories of the 
1991 riots in the Brooklyn neighborhood called Crown Heights, which is 
home to about 15,000 Orthodox Jews and more than 130,000 blacks.<br><br>As summer approaches, leaders from both sides are braced for trouble.<br><br>"One
small incident could escalate into something beyond our grasp," warned 
Richard Green, head of the Crown Heights Youth Collective, a group he 
said inspires the races "to interact instead of react."<br><br>The group
was started after the 1991 riots that exploded after a black child was 
accidentally struck by a station wagon in the motorcade of a Jewish 
spiritual leader. The 7-year-old boy, who was pinned under the vehicle, 
later died of his injuries. In the ensuing unrest, which lasted three 
days, a rabbinical student was mortally stabbed by a black mob.<br><br>To
quell fears of new unrest, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly visited 
Crown Heights earlier this month and stepped up police patrols. Officers
also are perched atop a tower, keeping 24-hour watch over the world 
headquarters of the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitch movement.<br><br>"It\'s a very delicate situation in Crown Heights, a bubble of tension," said Geoffrey Davis, a longtime black resident.<br><br>District
Attorney Charles Hynes has convened a grand jury to probe the April 14 
assault on Andrew Charles, a 20-year-old son of a police detective. He 
told police that a man on a bicycle sprayed him with mace while another 
man stepped out of an SUV, struck him with a wooden object and drove 
off.<br><br>Police have released a photograph of a 25-year-old member of
the local street patrol group, the Shmira, who is wanted for 
questioning in what Hynes calls "an unprovoked attack."<br><br>Police 
suspect the attack followed reports that black youths had pelted 
neighborhood homes with rocks. In May, residents say stones were hurled 
at a school bus carrying Jewish children.<br><br>Charles\' mother is 
accusing police of having "a double standard," noting that they\'ve made 
no arrest in her son\'s case while two black teenagers were quickly 
charged with beating and robbing a Jewish 16-year-old riding his bicycle
several weeks ago.<br><br>"My son\'s suspect is still at large almost a month after he was brutally assaulted!" said Charles\' mother, Wendy Craigg.<br><br>The prosecutor\'s office said it could not discuss the details of a case under investigation.<br><br>Members of the Shmira, which means "to watch" in Hebrew, are quick to show that they protect both blacks and Jews.<br><br>In
early May, a Jewish man standing in front of the Lubavitcher 
headquarters was surrounded by four black men who confronted him, 
cutting his hand. The Shmira chased down the four and called police, 
according to Yossi Stern, Shmira\'s director.<br><br>In another recent 
incident, Stern said, a young black woman leaving the subway was 
confronted by a knife-wielding man who forced her into an apartment 
building, where he tried to remove her clothing. Her screams were heard 
by a resident of the building -- a Shmira member who pursued the 
assailant and called 911.<br><br>But NYPD spokesman Paul Browne said 
that the Shmira "does not cooperate with police like other community 
watch groups who are our eyes and ears." He said the group has not 
supplied police officials with the names of its members, as do other 
such groups in the city.<br><br>Still, the current tensions don\'t even begin to approach 1991 levels.<br><br>Reported crimes in the precinct that includes Crown Heights have dropped steadily since then -- 77 percent in the past 15 years.<br><br>And
Green says community residents now have an outlet: Various groups like 
his formed after the riots to encourage common activities, from sports 
to the arts, while bridging differences to avert future clashes.<br><br>"Race
relations are absolutely better than in the \'90s, when we were like two
ships passing in the night, picking up each other\'s radar," said Green,
60, a Crown Heights resident and history professor at the City 
University of New York.</span>

<span>The British capital\'s new mayor, Boris Johnson is ending a 
controversial deal that has provided cheap Venezuelan fuel for London\'s 
transport network.<br><br>The agreement, signed last year by the 
Conservative Johnson\'s predecessor and Labour Party rival, Ken 
Livingstone, provided discounted gas for London\'s iconic red buses in 
exchange for advice on urban planning in Caracas, the Venezuelan 
capital.<br><br>Money saved on gas was put into a program providing 
half-rate bus fares for low-income Londoners. Livingstone said the 
anti-poverty initiative was the idea of Venezuela\'s left-wing leader, 
Hugo Chavez, whom Livingstone said he has long admired.<br><br>Conservative
critics said the deal allowed one of the world\'s richest cities to 
exploit a lesser developed country and handed a propaganda coup to a man
they called "a third-rate South American dictator."<br><br>Johnson echoed those criticisms in a statement announcing he would not renew the agreement when it expires in August.<br><br>"I
think many Londoners felt uncomfortable about the bus operation of one 
of the world\'s financial powerhouses being funded by the people of a 
country where many people live in extreme poverty," he said.<br>advertisement<br><br>The statement said poor Londoners could continue to take advantage of the reduced fares until the program ran its course.<br><br>A spokesman for the mayor said there were no plans to offer low-income residents advantageous bus fares beyond that point.</span>

said.<br><br>Four of the five crew members on board the Boeing 747 were 
slightly injured and were hospitalized, said Jan Van der Cruysse, 
spokesman at Brussels Airport.<br><br>"The plane is very seriously 
damaged," he said. The aircraft cracked in two after it crashed at the 
end of runway 220, which lies very close to a rail line and houses.<br><br>Rail
services to and from the airport were suspended as a safety precaution,
however the crash did not affect other flights at the airport, Van der 
Cruysse said.<br><br>Francis Vermeiren, mayor of the nearby town of 
Zaventem, said the plane did not catch on fire when it crashed after 
attempting to take off. Vermeiren was coordinating rescue efforts at the
airport.<br><br>"The plane is not on fire but it has split into two," he told VRT radio.<br><br>Firefighters
coated the wings of the plane with special fire retardant foam as a 
precaution because the plane was still full of jet fuel, the mayor said.<br><br>He said the plane was on a scheduled flight to Bahrain. It was not known what cargo the plane was carrying.<br><br>Vermeiren
said the pilot told rescue authorities he heard a large noise while 
trying to take off just after midday. It was not yet clear what caused 
the crash.<br><br>The plane is owned by Kalitta Air, a cargo carrier 
based at Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti, Michigan, and makes regular 
flights from Brussels, officials said. A person who answered the 
telephone at Kalitta Air said Sunday morning that no one was immediately
available to comment.</span>

<div>


<span>Two train track managers were convicted Friday of involuntary
manslaughter and fined in connection with a 2006 high-speed train crash
that killed 23 people.<br><br>The court ruled that the two managers 
failed to take the necessary precautions to protect the test track and 
trains in the northwestern town of Emsland against human error.<br><br>A
high-speed magnetic levitation, or maglev, train struck a maintenance 
vehicle on an elevated stretch of the track on September 22, 2006. The 
impact sliced open the train, which was traveling at 111 mph. Another 10
people were injured.<br><br>The managers were charged with indirectly 
causing the deaths by not having required that the maintenance vehicle 
be blocked from the track while a train was on it.<br><br>The Osnabrueck
state court ruled that Guenter Steinmetz, 67, and Joerg Metzner, 50, 
were guilty of involuntary manslaughter and causing bodily harm through 
negligence. But Judge Dieter Temming said the two were not criminals.<br><br>"The accident was for them a professional catastrophe," Temming said.<br><br>The court imposed fines of $37,800 and $31,500 respectively -- a punishment in line with what prosecutors had sought.<br><br>The
defense had sought the acquittal of the two men, who denied the 
accusations. Attorneys for both said they would appeal the verdict.<br><br>Prosecutors
have said they consider a third man -- the traffic controller at the 
time -- the chief suspect. However, proceedings against him were dropped
because he has received psychological treatment since the accident, and
is considered mentally unfit to stand trial.<br><br>High-speed maglev 
trains ride on a cushion of magnetism instead of rails, which eliminates
friction and helps make possible speeds of up to 270 mph.<br><br>The German train was made by Transrapid International, a joint company of Siemens AG and ThyssenKrupp AG.<br><br>Only
one commercially operated Transrapid stretch has been built so far -- 
in Shanghai, linking the Chinese city\'s financial district with its 
airport. Efforts to put it into commercial service in Germany have been 
thwarted by cost concerns.</span>

<span>A bomb exploded on a crowded commuter train in a southern 
suburb of Sri Lanka\'s capital Monday, killing seven people and wounding 
at least 62 others, police said.<br><br>The parcel bomb had been placed 
in the luggage rack on the train, which was bound for the southern town 
of Panadura, 27 kilometers (17 miles) from Colombo, police said. 
Investigators blamed the country\'s Tamil Tiger separatist movement for 
the attack, which occurred about 5:30pm in the southern suburb of 
Dehiwala.<br><br>Many of those on the train were office workers headed home at the end of the workday, police said.<br><br>The
bombing came amid a nationwide alert triggered by the discovery of at 
least three packages, in three different towns, that contained bombs. 
And it follows allegations by the Tamil Tigers, who are fighting for an 
independent Tamil homeland in northern Sri Lanka, that government forces
had killed 16 civilians in an attack on rebel-held territory in the 
Wanni region Friday.<br><br>The rebels also said the government killed an infant and a 17-year-old girl when warplanes bombed the area the same day.</span>

<span>Riot police beat and arrested several protesters early Monday
during an illegal rally by hundreds of opponents of a beef import 
agreement with the United States that has raised fears of mad cow 
disease in South Korea.<br><br>Several protesters were taken to nearby 
hospitals for treatment. A policeman "shoved me and slammed his shield 
into my right side, and the pain is killing me," Cho Ik-bi, a 
36-year-old businessman, told The Associated Press as he was taken to an
ambulance.<br><br>Police detained 31 people for questioning, a police 
officer at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said. He spoke on 
condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to 
reporters and declined to comment on the police violence.<br><br>Thousands
of South Koreans have held candlelight vigils and other protests 
against the April 18 deal to resume U.S. beef imports. They say the 
government of President Lee Myung-bak made too many concessions in the 
accord and that it does not include strict enough quarantine 
restrictions to protect against mad cow disease.<br><br>The protest movement is among the biggest domestic challenges faced by Lee in his first months in office.<br><br>On Sunday, police detained 37 other protesters at a separate rally urging the government to scrap the import deal.<br><br>Lee
last week sought to reassure the country on the safety of U.S. beef but
failed to ease public anger, fanned in part by media reports 
questioning the safety of the meat.<br><br>Lee has been criticized for 
making too many concessions on the beef issue to get the U.S. Congress 
to approve a free trade agreement. South Korea and the U.S. agreed to 
the landmark accord last year to slash tariffs and other trade barriers,
but the deal must be endorsed by legislatures in both capitals before 
it takes effect.<br><br>Prime Minister Han Seung-soo called on South Korea\'s legislature Monday to ratify the deal before its term ends this week.<br><br>Some
700 protesters marched through the capital until the early hours of the
morning. Some of them called for Lee\'s impeachment, saying he was 
sacrificing public safety for political gain.<br><br>The April 18 
agreement scrapped nearly all the quarantine restrictions imposed by the
previous government to guard against mad cow disease.<br><br>The South 
Korean government was preparing to make an announcement on revised 
quarantine restrictions and the safety of American beef imports as early
as Tuesday, clearing the way to put it back on Korean store shelves.<br><br>A
government delegation was to return home later Monday after conducting 
on-site inspections of beef industry facilities in the U.S., said Kim 
Hyun-soo, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman. He did not give further 
details.<br><br>South Korea suspended U.S. beef imports after the first 
American case of mad cow disease appeared in December 2003 in a 
Canadian-born cow in Washington state.<br><br>Restricted imports of U.S.
beef reached South Korean supermarkets last year, but further shipments
were canceled in October after banned parts, such as bones, were found.<br><br>Scientists
believe mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, spreads 
when farmers feed cattle with recycled meat and bones from infected 
animals. In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal malady, 
is linked to eating meat products contaminated with the cattle disease. <br></span>

<span>A court in Japan convicted an alleged gangster and sentenced 
him to death Monday for the fatal shooting of a popular mayor in a crime
that stunned a nation that takes pride in its rigid gun-control laws.<br><br>The
defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death Monday in 
Nagasaki District Court, court spokesman Hiroyuki Mano said.<br><br>Prosecutors had sought the death penalty, while the defense had argued that was too harsh.<br><br>Mayor
Iccho Ito, 61, was shot twice in the back at close range outside a 
train station in April last year while campaigning for re-election for 
his fourth term.<br><br>The crime was lambasted as an act of violence 
that aimed to stifle democracy, and it also raised fears about guns on 
the streets as well as about organized crime in a nation that has long 
boasted a relatively crime-free record.<br><br>Tetsuya Shiroo, 60, who 
police say is a senior member of Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan\'s largest 
organized crime syndicate, was arrested on the scene. He told police he 
was angry at the city for refusing to compensate him after his car was 
damaged at a public works construction site.<br><br>The assassination 
was the second attack in 20 years against a mayor of the southwestern 
city, whose politicians historically have been outspoken pacifists.<br><br>In
1990, Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was shot and seriously wounded after 
saying that Japan\'s emperor bore some responsibility for World War II, 
enraging rightist-leaning nationalists. A right-wing terrorist was 
arrested in that attack.<br><br>One of Ito\'s daughters, Yuko Yokoo, welcomed the punishment as what the family had wanted.<br><br>"But
even then, we the family are left with nothing," she said on nationally
televised news. "We can only hope that this sends a message that such a
crime will never be repeated."<br><br>Known as yakuza, gangsters are 
often involved in construction businesses, corporate extortion, 
gambling, the sex trade and drug trafficking.<br><br>According to the 
latest police report, gang members in Japan number about 84,200. They 
are behind two-thirds of Japan\'s reported shootings, which are still 
rare compared to in the United States and other nations at only 65 a 
year.<br><br>"We feel even stronger our determination to make Nagasaki a
city free of gangsters," its current Mayor Tomohisa Taue said on NHK 
TV.<br><br>Ito was born in Nagasaki on August 23, 1945, just two weeks 
after the U.S. atomic bombing of the city towards the end of World War 
II. The other city to suffer atomic bombing was nearby Hiroshima.</span>

<span>An ex-rebel leader who served as a vice president of Congo 
was arrested near Brussels, Belgium on Saturday on charges of war crimes
and crimes against humanity, according to International Criminal Court.<br><br>The independent high court -- based in The Hague, Netherlands -- issued an arrest warrant on Friday for Jean-Pierre Bemba.<br><br>The
court alleges that between October 2002 and March 2003, Bemba\'s rebel 
group carried out a widespread attack against civilians using torture, 
rape, pillaging and "outrages upon personal dignity," according to an 
ICC statement.<br><br>Bemba, head of the rebellious Movement for the 
Liberation of Congo, was one of four vice presidents in the transitional
government of the Democratic Republic of Congo from 2003 to 2006.<br><br>He
was involved in a power-sharing government created in 2002, which 
allowed members from four rebel groups to fill each of the four vice 
presidential seats.<br>advertisement<br><br>The agreement was supposed 
to resolve a conflict that sucked in the armies of six nations, split 
the vast country into rebel- and government-held regions and killed an 
estimated 2.5 million people, mainly through disease and hunger.<br><br>War
broke out in Congo in August 1998 when Rwanda and Uganda backed 
Congolese rebels seeking to oust Congo President Laurent Kabila, 
accusing him of supporting groups, including the Hutu militia, which 
threatened their security. Kabila was assassinated three years later.</span>

<span>Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai returned to 
Zimbabwe Saturday for the first time since leaving the country shortly 
after the controversial March 29 election.<br><br>Tsvangirai -- who 
contends he won the presidential race against longtime Zimbabwe leader 
Robert Mugabe -- returned despite what his party said was a plot by the 
country\'s military to assassinate him and other party leaders.<br><br>The
Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, after a long delay, ruled that neither 
candidate won a necessary majority of the vote and set a date of June 27
for Tsvangirai to again face Mugabe in a runoff vote.<br><br>Tsvangirai
and his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) have called for 
international observers to be allowed to monitor the runoff election, 
but Mugabe\'s government has refused the demand.<br><br>Tsvangirai is expected to tour hospitals in Harare to visit victims of post-election violence.<br><br>An
MDC spokesman said two party members were found dead Wednesday night 
after being abducted from their homes in the Zimbabwean capital of 
Harare.<br><br>Tsvangirai\'s spokesman George Sibotshiwe said Saturday 
that the opposition leader and the entire MDC leadership are "at risk 
from this brutal regime." When contacted by CNN, a Cabinet member denied
that the government had any possible role in the alleged plot, and said
the report was an effort by the MDC to gain international sympathy.<br><br>Chen
Chimutengwende, Zimbabwe\'s minister of public and interactive affairs, 
accused Tsvangirai of "trying to paint a false picture of what Zimbabwe 
and Zimbabwe authorities are like."<br><br>"There is no plot against him
and there has never been any plot against him and he knows that," 
Chimutengwende said. He called the reports from Tsvangirai\'s party "an 
effort to get sympathy from the international community."<br><br>There 
have been numerous reports from the MDC and church groups since the 
March balloting about kidnappings, torture, and other violence, 
including the deaths of opposition party members. They say the violence 
targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party.<br><br>Mugabe has ruled the southern African country since it became independent 28 years ago. <br></span>

<span>California firefighters need more equipment and staff to 
handle wildfires that are increasingly a year-round problem, Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger said Friday.<br><br>He visited the scene of the 
3,100-acre Summit fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Northern 
California, where about 1,100 firefighters are working to contain the 
blaze. He praised them as "the best-trained, the most courageous, the 
most well-equipped and most selfless firefighters in the world," but 
said the state needs to be better prepared for such emergencies.<br><br>Schwarzenegger is pushing for an increase in homeowners\' insurance fees he said would raise $100 million for fire protection.<br><br>"I
think we need those extra engines. We need more manpower. We need more 
aircraft. We need to update our aircraft that are outdated," he said. 
"So there\'s a lot of work that needs to be done, but we are continuing 
to increase all those things, so our firefighters are very well 
protected and that we are protected."<br><br>The fast-burning Summit 
fire grew to 3,100 acres Friday, leaving 12 burned structures in its 
wake and prompting rescues and evacuations in two counties, according to
the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. But 
firefighters were being helped by calmer conditions -- 30-mph winds that
had fanned the blaze faded away.<br><br>Still, the fire was only 20 
percent contained Friday afternoon, the agency reported. It has 
threatened about 500 homes and 20 businesses, said Chris Morgan of the 
forestry and fire protection department, and more than 1,700 people have
been evacuated.<br><br>Five planes and 10 helicopters have been used to
drop water on the fire since it began early Thursday, including a 
"supertanker" -- a jumbo jet modified to battle fires from the air. The 
fire\'s cause is still under investigation.<br><br>Schwarzenegger said the state is grappling with fires that no longer seem limited to the typical spring period.<br><br>"Now we have seen fires all year round," he said.</span>

(AP) -- Wall Street investment companies are reducing their borrowing 
from the Federal Reserve\'s emergency lending program.<br><br>The Federal
Reserve said in a report Thursday that those companies averaged $14.2

Bernanke and his colleagues invoked the broadest use of the central

investment houses obtain emergency financing from the Fed. That was a

program, similar to one the Fed long has had for commercial banks, will 
continue for at least six months. It gives investment companies a place

pay 2.25% in interest for the loans.<br><br>Banks also reduced their 
borrowing, according to the report. They averaged $13.5 billion in daily
borrowing for the week ending May 21, compared with $14.4 billion for 
the previous week. The identities of commercial banks and investment 
houses are not released.<br><br>Bernanke recently said turmoil in financial markets has eased somewhat, but the situation is still "far from normal."<br><br>Fed
auctions: As part of efforts to relieve credit strains, the Fed 
auctioned $46.1 billion in Treasury securities to investment companies 
Thursday. <br><br>The ninth and latest auction drew bids for less than 
the $75 billion available. That could be a sign of some improvement in 
credit conditions.<br><br>In exchange for the 28-day loans of Treasury 
securities, bidding companies can put up as collateral more risky 
investments. These include certain mortgage-backed securities and bonds 
secured by federally guaranteed student loans.<br><br>The auction 
program, which began March 27, is intended to make investment companies 
more inclined to lend to each other. A second goal is providing relief 
to the distressed market for mortgage-linked securities and for student 
loans.<br>',

sustainable.<br><br>NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Oil prices have doubled 
in the past 12 months, surging nearly $8 a barrel in the past four days 
alone.<br><br>Big investment funds are putting money into oil futures as
if Saudi Arabia\'s spigots will run dry tomorrow. At the same time, the 
supply of oil and the demand for it hasn\'t changed much in the last 
year.<br><br>So it raises the question: Is $130 oil nothing more than one big bubble?<br><br>The answer depends on who you ask.<br><br>"A
bubble is where supply overwhelms demand," said Stephen Leeb, an 
investment manager who has authored two books on oil scarcity.<br><br>Leeb
pointed to previous bubbles - like the tech bubble in the late 1990s 
where companies with zero earnings issued massive amounts of stock, and 
the real estate market a decade later where home builders went on a 
frenzy, overshooting the number of homes the market could absorb.<br><br>"But unless I\'m missing something here, I don\'t see any massive increase in the supply of oil," he said.<br><br>Like
many in the not-a-bubble camp, Leeb pointed to surging demand from 
places like China - some estimates see auto ownership there surging 
30-fold in the next few decades - coupled with dwindling supplies as the
main reasons behind pricey oil.<br><br>Thursday, the International 
Energy Agency gave advance warning that its previous forecast for supply
and demand remaining in pleasant equilibrium over the next two decades 
was flawed. Its new projections, due in November, will say supplies may 
fall 10 percent short of demand, according to a report in the Wall 
Street Journal.<br><br>Leeb said Russia was already seeing a drop in 
production, and there\'s little evidence Saudi Arabia could increase 
production even if it wanted to.<br><br>"If the two biggest oil producers in the world can no longer increase production, that\'s a catastrophe, not a bubble," he said.<br><br>Others say there\'s no way $130 oil is justified.<br><br>"This
thing has to turn around, it\'s insanity," said Peter Beutel, an oil 
analyst at the consultancy Cameron Hanover. "Ultimately we\'ll see a huge
collapse in prices."<br><br>Beutel doesn\'t know when that collapse would come, but he predicts it will be within weeks or months, not years.<br><br>But
he doesn\'t know just what might bring it about - perhaps the Federal 
Reserve increasing interest rates or a big drop in consumption as people
worldwide can no longer afford to fuel their cars or heat their homes.<br><br>"If
these prices stick, you may see whole neighborhoods where people 
abandon their homes," he said predicting that in the Northeast U.S. it 
will cost $5000 to heat a home unless prices fall.<br><br>Many analysts said supply and demand justifies expensive oil - maybe $90 or $100 a barrel - but $130 is just too much.<br><br>"To
see something run this far and this fast, you see it leveraged by 
financial players," said Neal Dingmann, senior energy analyst at Dahlman
Rose &amp; Co., a New York-based energy investment boutique. "The 
direction is corect, the speed isn\'t."<br><br>Dingman said demand is 
slowing in the U.S., and the Chinese numbers are inflated because they 
assume the government will continue to subsidize fuel, which he feels 
they won\'t do.<br><br>Over the next five or ten years, he said it would 
be possible to see a return to $70 or $80 oil by gradually increasing 
supply - both in OPEC countries and non-OPEC countries like Brazil, as 
well as aggressive measures to limit demand like increasing fuel 
efficiency standards.<br><br>Robert Kaufmann, director of Boston 
University\'s Center for Energy and Environmental Studies, also says oil 
is overpriced by about $30.<br><br>He says current markets are adequately supplied, and traders are pricing in future predictions of surging demand.<br><br>"To me, that\'s a bubble," he said.<br><br>But
Kaufmann still thinks oil should be priced at around $100. He says 
supplies just aren\'t growing, and the only way to bring prices down to 
the $100 range is to reduce consumption.<br><br>"Even when that bubble pops, you\'re not looking at $60, $70 oil," he said.<br>',

<span>Gas prices rise again and force some holiday drivers to stay off the roads. Travel expected to lessen for first time since 2002.<br><br>NEW
YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Drivers marking the start of summer holiday 
travel season this weekend are really paying for it at the pump.<br><br>The price of gasoline rose for the 20th straight day to less than a dime shy of $4, motorist organization AAA reported Monday.<br><br>According
to AAA, the national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose to a
record high of $3.936, up six-tenths of a cent from the previous high 
of $3.930.<br><br>What a difference a year makes: Last Memorial Day weekend, drivers paid an average of $3.23 a gallon.<br><br>Indeed, as gas prices have surged, some drivers have pulled back.<br><br>The
U.S. Federal Highway Administration said Monday it estimates that 
Americans drove 4.3% fewer miles on public roads in March. The change - 
the first year-over-year March decline since 1979 - continues an overall
drop in driving that began last November, the agency said.<br><br>According
to AAA, for the first time since 2002, Americans said they were 
planning to drive less over the Memorial Day weekend than they did the 
year before.<br><br>The number of Americans traveling 50 or more miles 
from home this holiday weekend was expected to slip by 0.9% to 37.87 
million, the motorist group forecast recently.<br><br>"Most people are going to travel closer to home this year, and they\'re going to take fewer trips," said AAA spokesman Mike Pina.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>iReport.com: Share your stories from the pump<br><br>Among
the estimated 12% of Americans who will be traveling this weekend, AAA 
said 31.7 million people, or 83%, are expected to drive. That\'s slightly
fewer than the 32 million Memorial Day drivers a year ago.<br><br>The 
AAA survey was conducted during the last week of April, when gas was at 
$3.50 a gallon. Now, drivers in 11 states and the District of Columbia 
are paying an average above $4 per gallon.<br><br>A Deloitte &amp; 
Touche survey of more than 1,000 Americans conducted May 12-14 found 
that, as a result of the rise in gas prices, 23% of Americans had 
altered their Memorial Day weekend travel plans.<br><br>Deloitte &amp; 
Touche found that 12% of would-be travelers had cancelled their vacation
plans altogether, and 11% planned on traveling closer to home.<br><br>The
average traveler is expected to drive 91 miles to and from home this 
weekend, according to the Deloitte &amp; Touche survey. The average car 
gets 20.2 miles per gallon, according to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, so that 91-mile trip will cost drivers $34.92. Last 
year, that same trip would have cost $29.10.<br><br>Air travel will give
vacationers no respite from high fuel costs: For the 11% of travelers 
who planned on flying, the price of a ticket was expected to be 8% 
higher than it was last year. Most U.S. air carriers have announced fuel
surcharges this spring.<br><br>Much of the run-up in gasoline can be attributed to record crude oil prices, which have more than doubled over the past year.</span>

Stockport County manager Jim Gannon paid tribute to 
his young team after they defeated Rochdale 3-2 in the League Two 
play-off final.
"I hope that we become a role model for all clubs at this level," said Gannon.
"Over the past two years we have brought through a group of young 
players who in the right circumstances, play really good, effective 
football.
"It would be nice to keep them together but I think some of them are destined for great things."
Rory McArdle had put Rochdale ahead in Sunday\'s final at Wembley 
before Nathan Stanton diverted a cross into his own net to ensure 
Stockport went into the break on level terms.
But Anthony Pilkington headed the Hatters ahead shortly after the 
restart and Liam Dickinson extended their lead before a superb volley 
from Adam Rundle ensured a tight finish.
It was the Hatters first victory at Wembley in their fifth attempt - 
and boss Gannon had played in all of the previous four defeats.
However, despite the defeats, Gannon was part of a Stockport team 
that won promotion from the Football League\'s bottom division to the 
second tier of English football.
"We had the experience of the play-offs in the \'90s and defeat was 
hard to take but it was all part of growing as a club," added Gannon.
"I enjoyed my performances here as a player but to see the club go 
from the lower reaches of the fourth division to the top of the 
Championship was a great experience.
"Why couldn\'t that happen again? It would be tougher now but this club is on the up.
"We play young players and that is what our level of football should be about.
"It should be a breeding ground for good footballers and good 
football, not full of journeymen playing out time on their careers."
Rochdale manager Keith Hill admitted that Stockport were the better team on the day.
"I think that Stockport deserved it," said Hill.
"It could have gone either way and we gave it what we could but the lion\'s share of possession went to Stockport.
"We went for it at 3-1 down but overall Stockport deserved to go up.
"The lads deserve great credit for the season they have had and will be stronger for the experience.
<span>"We have to learn from this and come back and get promotion next season." <br></span>

including the soccer federation," said the head of the Iraqi Football 
Association Hussein Saeed.<br><br>"We sent a copy of the letter to Fifa. We don\'t know whether they will change their mind or not."<br><br>Sports
Minister Jasem Mohammed Jaafar said the government had sent 
clarification to the football federation because the old decision was 
vague and misinterpreted.<br><br>"We have done what we could. If Fifa 
doesn\'t reverse its decision and Iraq doesn\'t play in the World Cup, we 
won\'t be responsible," he said.<br><br>Fifa president Sepp Blatter said 
earlier that he hoped the ban would lead the Iraqi government to change 
their mind in time for Iraq to continue their qualification campaign.<br><br>Blatter
told The Australian newspaper: "Iraq are the Asian champions and 
brought so much hope and joy to their country when they won the final in
Malaysia last year.<br><br>"I am confident there is enough pressure on the government to help them change their mind."<br><br>Iraq are set to play Australia in Brisbane on 1 June and in Dubai on 7 June.<br><br>The
Socceroos are top of Group One of the Asia qualifying section with four
points from two games. Iraq are bottom with one point from two games.<br>',

<span>Carson Yeung is still interested in taking full control of Birmingham City, according to his spokesman Sammy Yu.<br><br>Yeung is the club\'s largest individual shareholder after buying an initial 29.9% stake last summer.<br><br>The
Hong Kong businessman was later heavily criticised for not completely 
buying out chairman David Gold and co-owner David Sullivan.<br><br>But Yu said: "Hopefully one day we can take the club over. All we have done is support the club."<br><br>Gold
claimed the uncertainty over Yeung\'s long-term plans cost Birmingham 
the services of manager Steve Bruce, who left St Andrews to take over at
Wigan in November.<br><br>Bruce kept the Latics in the Premier League, 
while Birmingham were relegated to the Championship under his successor 
Alex McLeish.<br><br>"We thought that if we got involved in the club at 
least for some time, then we could take over and guarantee that nothing 
will go wrong," added Yu, who is chief operating officer of Yeung\'s 
investment company Grandtop International Holdings.<br><br>"But then 
when an article appeared in a Birmingham match programme saying that Mr 
Sullivan would not deal with Mr Yeung, it made us feel disappointed 
because it was not even close to the so-called deadline to buy the club 
outright.<br><br>"We have been very polite but they have been quite 
unreasonable. We didn\'t ask for anything nor have we done anything to 
hurt the club."<br><br>Yeung had been set a deadline of 21 December 2007
to complete his buy-out, but the Blues released a statement to the 
Stock Exchange on 20 December to announce that discussions had been 
terminated.</span>

<span>Derry City boss Stephen Kenny expects a "frenetic affair" in 
Tuesday\'s Eircom Premier League derby against Finn Harps at Ballybofey 
(2000 BST).<br><br>The Candystripes impressed in Friday\'s 4-1 thumping 
of UCD but Harps claimed a fine 3-1 win at Cobh Ramblers and are 
unbeaten in their last three matches.<br><br>"Both teams will be coming off something of a high on Friday," Kenny told BBC Sport.<br><br>"The UCD game was quite open. I think this will be a different type of game."<br><br>The
Derry squad is likely to be unchanged from the win over UCD with Sammy 
Morrow, Paddy McCourt and Sean Hargan all set to resume training in 
about a week.<br><br>"The League break is coming up and after the break we should have nearly everyone back.<br><br>"But
our players have been excellent so far this season. To get into third 
place in the table, considering we have been missing quite a few players
has been a good effort."<br><br>After being goal shy for a number of weeks, Kenny was delighted by his team\'s finishing against UCD.<br><br>"The
quality of the goals that the team scored on Friday was excellent. 
Niall McGinn\'s strike and Owen Morrison and Kevin McHugh and Mark Farren
getting another goal.<br><br>"Mark is joint-top scorer in the league now with five goals which says a lot about the tightness of the league."<br><br>Derry go into Tuesday\'s round of games six points behind leaders St Pat\'s, who play second placed Bohemians at Inchicore.<br><br>Bohemians are currently two points behind Pat\'s and four ahead of Derry. <br></span>

gutsy Queen of the South\'s hopes of winning their first Scottish Cup

the biggest shock in cup final history looked on the cards when Stevie 
Tosh forced the ball home and Jim Thomson headed in an equaliser.<br><br>But Boyd, so often left on the bench this season, rose to head the winner.<br><br>And
Rangers, playing their 68th game of an arduous season, limped home to 
ensure their 32nd Scottish Cup final triumph - their first in five 
years.<br><br>Rangers manager Walter Smith had made four changes in an 
attempt to freshen up a side that were playing their fourth game in 
eight days.<br><br>Boyd, Beasley, Sasa Papac and Lee McCulloch came in for Christian Dailly, Steven Davis, Daniel Cousin and Charlie Adam.<br><br>Queens were reduced to 10 men within minutes when midfielder Ryan McCann had to go off for a couple of stitches in a head wound.<br><br>But
he quickly returned as the Dumfries outfit, playing their first 
competitive match in four weeks after finishing fourth in the First 
Division, matched their more illustrious rivals for endevour and 
possession in the early stages.<br><br>Carlos Cuellar, who has been 
Scotland\'s outstanding player this season, exemplified the tired legs 
among the Rangers players with a couple of loose passes.<br><br>But the 
Glasgow side - who won the CIS Cup earlier in the season - steadied 
themselves and ought to have taken the lead with the first clear sight 
of goal after 24 minutes.<br><br>Boyd broke clear and clipped a neat 
ball into the path of Beasley, who curled his shot into the wrong side 
of the netting behind the post from the edge of the penalty box.<br><br>The
same two combined again moments later, with the unmarked Boyd 
squandering a great opportunity by sending a diving header a few feet 
over from 10 yards.<br><br>However, he made no mistake and after 33 minutes, after Beasley won a foul following a Tosh challenge.<br><br>Barry Ferguson teed it up for Boyd to bullet his drive into the top corner from 22 yards and Rangers\' steps visibly quickened.<br><br>But,
despite their growing stranglehold on possession, Tosh broke through 
only for the diving Neil Alexander to save at the veteran midfielder\'s 
feet.<br><br>There were shouts for a penalty when Steven Whittaker blocked the path of Sean O\'Connor.<br><br>But
it was a collision between Queens players McCann and Jim Thomson inside
the other box that enabled Rangers to stretch their lead.<br><br>It 
allowed Cuellar\'s header to the back post to fall for Beasley, whose 
side-footed effort from 12 yards slipped under goalkeeper Jamie 
MacDonald.<br><br>It looked like there would be no way back for Queens, 
but two goals within eight minutes after the break turned a thrilling 
game on its head.<br><br>O\'Connor slipped clear of Cuellar in the box 
and the striker\'s drive into the six-yard box was punched home off the 
pelvis of Tosh.<br><br>A Boyd header was well held by MacDonald before 
Queens broke up the other end, where Thomson rose to head home a Bob 
Harris free-kick from 10 yards.<br><br>Rangers were looking nervous again and Cuellar\'s last-ditch tackle denied O\'Connor at the front post.<br><br>But Boyd came to the rescue, heading home in a crowded penalty box from a Beasley corner after 72 minutes.<br><br>That
appeared to knock the wind out of Queens\' sails and Rangers went on to a
victory that will go some way to making up for the disappointment of 
missing out on the Scottish Premier League title less than 48 hours 
earlier and defeat in the Uefa Cup final.<br>',

<br>Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in Iron Man
<br>


The 
Marvel Comics adaptation, starring Robert Downey Jr. as the guy in the 
metal suit, hauled in $100.7 million over opening weekend and $104.2 
million since debuting Thursday night, the second-best premiere ever for
a non-sequel, according to studio estimates Sunday.

"Iron Man" was pure gold at the box office.
The Marvel Comics adaptation, starring Robert Downey Jr. as the guy 
in the metal suit, hauled in $100.7 million over opening weekend and 
$104.2 million since debuting Thursday night, the second-best premiere 
ever for a non-sequel, according to studio estimates Sunday.
The film also scored overseas with $96.7 million in 57 countries 
where it began opening Wednesday, putting its worldwide total at $201 
million.
Distributed by Paramount, "Iron Man" was the first release by Marvel 
Studios, which has begun financing its own productions after such 
studio-backed hits as the "Spider-Man," "X-Men" and "Fantastic Four" 
flicks.
"We could not have hoped for a better way for Marvel Studios to blast
off," said David Maisel, chairman of the unit, a division of Marvel 
Entertainment, which stands to pull in a greater share of box-office 
receipts and merchandising money by financing movies itself.
<div><b>Super-strong debut</b></div>
Debuting in second-place with $15.5 million was Sony\'s romantic 
comedy "Made of Honor," starring "Grey\'s Anatomy" heartthrob Patrick 
Dempsey as a man who tries to woo his best pal after she asks him to be 
"maid of honor" at her wedding.
With rave reviews from many critics, "Iron Man" features Downey as 
billionaire arms designer Tony Stark, a boozy womanizer who builds a 
high-tech suit and becomes a superhero, mending his ways after he\'s 
taken captive and sees firsthand the devastation his weapons cause.
Directed by Jon Favreau, the film also stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard.
Despite the huge "Iron Man" opening, Hollywood\'s overall business was
down compared to the same weekend last year, when "Spider-Man 3" had a 
record debut of $151.1 million. The top-12 movies took in $154.1 
million, off 15 percent from a year ago.
"Nonetheless, \'Iron Man\' did better than 
expected," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker 
Media By Numbers. "This is certainly the shot in the arm the marketplace
has needed."
After a sleepy few months, movie attendance this year is running 6 
percent behind that of 2007, so the arrival of "Iron Man" may jump-start
the box office as the busy summer season begins. iReport.com: What did 
you think of "Iron Man?"
"If that first May movie is a big hit, it tends to lead to a big 
summer," said Rob Moore, Paramount vice chairman. "There hadn\'t been a 
big event movie yet this year. So you have the first event movie of 
summer, and people go, \'And I hear it\'s really good. All right, I\'m 
in.\'"
<span><br>"Iron Man" was the 10th-biggest opening of all-time and the 
fourth-biggest for a superhero movie. Among non-sequels, it came in 
behind only the first "Spider-Man," which premiered with $114.8 million.</span>
"If we have to, we\'re happy to come in second to another Marvel 
property," Maisel said. "It emphasizes how lucky we are to have such a 
powerful brand that\'s not loved by just comic-book fans but also general
movie fans."
The next Marvel production arrives in June with "The Incredible Hulk," distributed by Universal and starring Edward Norton.
In limited release, David Mamet\'s martial-arts drama "Redbelt" opened
solidly with $68,646 in six theaters. Released by Sony Pictures 
Classics, "Redbelt" stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as an honorable instructor 
caught up in corruption in the world of mixed martial-arts competitions.
Paramount Vantage\'s "Son of Rambow," a comic tale of two British boys
making their own "Rambo" movie, also opened well with $52,549 in five 
theaters.

<span>Studio executives hope they\'ve trained their audience well as the season of summer blockbusters arrives.<br><br>From
May through mid-August, Hollywood will bank on the idea that there is 
at least one movie every week -- and sometimes two -- that you simply 
must see.<br><br>Summer features such box-office staples as Will Smith, 
Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller and Jack Black, and brings back beloved 
characters such as Indiana Jones, Batman, Speed Racer, Carrie and her 
"Sex and the City" gal pals, the "Narnia" kids, the Incredible Hulk and 
two very different agent couples: paranormal troupers Mulder and Scully 
and comic spies Maxwell Smart and Agent 99.<br><br>A look at the lineup:<br><br>MAY
2: Heavy hitters like "Spider-Man" and "Superman" are established 
big-screen figures, but the comic-book world has a deep bench.<br><br>Robert
Downey Jr. takes the lead in "Iron Man," playing a wealthy inventor who
lacks superpowers but does have a nifty high-tech suit of armor that 
really leaves an impression when he gives villains a knuckle sandwich.<br><br><br>Gwyneth
Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges co-star in the tale based on 
the Marvel Comics hero, a man with a subversive sense of humor who 
starts off as "not the most likable fellow," said director Jon Favreau.<br><br>With
"Iron Man" less familiar to audiences than Supe or Spidey, it took an 
actor of Downey\'s status to ease some worries Favreau had.<br><br>"My 
biggest concern was that it would slide into some B-hero wheeled out by 
Marvel, that this movie would be a poor man\'s \'Spider-Man,\' " Favreau 
said. "Hiring Robert, the challenge shifted from whether it was going to
be good or bad to how far we were going to push things and bend the 
genre."<br><br>MAY 9: Andy and Larry Wachowski turned virtual reality on
its head with "The Matrix." Now they follow their R-rated franchise 
with the family-friendly adventure "Speed Racer," an adaptation of the 
animated show starring Emile Hirsch as the kid roaring along the 
roadways, Christina Ricci as his helicopter-flying girlfriend and 
Matthew Fox as mystery man Racer X. The film will also be released in 
IMAX.<br><br>A fan of "Speed Racer" growing up, Hirsch said he wanted in
as soon as he heard the Wachowski brothers were writing and directing.<br><br>"Seeing
\'The Matrix\' for the first time when I was 13 to this day is one of my 
most memorable experiences ever in a movie theater," Hirsch said. "I 
already loved the show, and for guys of that kind of caliber to get 
involved with it could only be something special."<br><br>MAY 16: Things
sure can change in 1,300 years, as Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy 
Pevensie learn when they go over the rainbow again in "The Chronicles of
Narnia: Prince Caspian," the second installment in the fantasy 
franchise based on C.S. Lewis\' books.<br><br>Only a short time has 
passed for the siblings in England, but centuries have gone by in 
Narnia, which now is under the bootheel of the tyrannical Telmarines and
mean King Miraz. The Pevensies encounter a new ally -- Caspian (Ben 
Barnes), the rightful heir to Narnia\'s throne -- and are reacquainted 
with old buddy Aslan the lion, again voiced by Liam Neeson.<br><br>The 
three years since the first movie, "The Lion, the Witch and the 
Wardrobe," have resulted in huge digital advancements in how director 
Andrew Adamson could depict computer-generated creatures such as Aslan.<br><br>"It\'s
little things like when Lucy first sees him this time, she runs up and 
gives him a hug. ... It\'s a great image to see a little girl hug a 
lion," Adamson said. "And there\'s a great shot in this film where Aslan 
actually tackles someone off a horse and rolls around on the ground with
them. The level of interactivity makes it so much more real."<br><br>MAY 22: Cue the Indy fanfare. Henry Jones Jr. is cracking his whip again.<br><br>"Indiana
Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" reunites the dream team of 
Harrison Ford as the archaeologist-adventurer, director Steven Spielberg
and creator-producer George Lucas.<br><br>It\'s been 19 years since the 
last movie, and the fourth film hurtles the aging Indy from his 
Nazi-fighting days of the 1930s to the Cold War era of the \'50s, with 
Cate Blanchett as a Soviet operative and Karen Allen returning as Marion
Ravenwood, his love interest from 1981\'s "Raiders of the Ark."<br><br>Unlike
film franchises that crank up the action and effects with each sequel, 
Spielberg, Lucas and Ford are offering an old-school Indy.<br><br>"We 
did everything exactly the way we did it before, so if you expect F-14s 
flying into freeways, it ain\'t gonna happen," Lucas said. "If you expect
this to suddenly have bells and whistles and have 10 times more 
whatever than the first ones, it\'s not. It\'s just like a continuation. 
It\'s like sitting down on a cozy old sofa that you\'ve had for 20 years 
and having the same experience."<br><br>What sort of toll did the action
take on 65-year-old Ford, who sustained knee and back injuries on some 
of the earlier "Indiana Jones" movies?<br><br>"I broke a fingernail," Ford said. "I walked away with a hangnail."<br><br>As
for the big question fans have posed -- is co-star Shia LaBeouf the 
love child of Indy and Marion? -- neither Ford nor Lucas will say.<br><br>"I
can\'t say that. I\'m not allowed. Steven would kill me. You\'ll have to 
get that out of Steven," Lucas said. "If you get it out of him, then it 
must be true." <br><br>JUNE 13: When we last saw Marvel Comics\' big 
angry green guy, he was hopping around in the desert in Ang Lee\'s 
"Hulk," a critical and commercial disappointment. <br><br>The Marvel 
gang went back to the drawing board for "The Incredible Hulk," starring 
Edward Norton in a new take that the filmmakers say will channel both 
the comic books and the 1970s and \'80s TV show starring Bill Bixby.<br><br>The
movie wastes no time explaining how Norton\'s Bruce Banner was 
transformed into a man who mutates into the Hulk when angered, said 
producer Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios\' head of production. The story 
hints at what happened to him then jumps into the action, he said.<br><br>"This
is not an origin story," Feige said. "We are assuming everyone buying a
ticket will know Bruce Banner is a scientist on the run who grows into a
green hulk 9 feet tall. That\'s all people need to know. So the 
adventure is off and running right from the beginning."<br><br>JULY 18: 
Batman is back with "The Dark Knight," reuniting star Christian Bale 
with director Christopher Nolan and pitting the soul-searching 
crimefighter against his greatest enemy, the Joker, played by the late 
Heath Ledger in his next-to-last role. The film will also be released in
IMAX, and Nolan filmed some scenes in the large-form technology.<br><br>With
great buzz on Ledger\'s frantic performance and his demonic makeup, the 
Joker is the corrupted flip-side of Batman, who lives by a strict code 
despite raging inner turmoil.<br><br>"It\'s a fine line, something which 
we kind of toy with in the story, of this fine line, essentially both 
being freaks to most people, both being idealists," Bale said. "The 
Joker trying to show the hypocrisy of society and trying to show Batman 
that his way just ultimately can\'t work. These rules that he places on 
himself are just a joke."</span>

<span>Heroes come in all shapes and sizes -- from the gun-packing 
maverick who shoots first and asks questions later to the unlikely hero,
blinking with surprise at his newly found ass-kicking skills.<br><br>But
what\'s common among all celluloid champions is that they are prepared 
to fight for what they believe in -- even if it means risking their 
lives.<br><br>We\'ve compiled a list of 10 of the best. Don\'t agree? 
Think we\'ve missed one? Share your views by using the Sound Off box 
below and we\'ll publish the best.<br><br>10. Neo (Keanu Reeves) "The Matrix"<br>(Andy &amp; Larry Wachowski, 1999)<br><br>In
"real life" Neo is a reclusive computer hacker but when he lifts the 
virtual reality cloak and enters the matrix he finds he is innately 
gifted. He can dodge bullets and has unimaginable strength but his true 
heroism stems from having the courage to fight the seemingly invincible 
Mr Smith to try to free humanity from enslavement.<br><br>9. James Bond (Sean Connery) "Dr No."<br>(Terence Young, 1962)<br><br>From
the moment Connery\'s gentleman spy utters the words, "The name\'s Bond, 
James Bond," it\'s certain that for every pussy-stroking nemesis he 
encounters he will have just the right exploding pen, aquatic sports 
car, or suave quip to prevail. Then he\'ll smooth down his tux and snog a
babe safe in the knowledge he\'s saved the world once again.<br><br>8. Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) "The Silence of the Lambs"<br>(Jonathan Demme, 1991)<br><br>Starling,
an ambitious FBI trainee, is in way over her head. She gets intimate 
with Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist turned cannibal in the 
hopes he will give her clues in the hunt for mass murderer, Buffalo 
Bill. When she inadvertently stumbles on Bill\'s underground lair, he 
blows the fuse and, terrifyingly, stalks her in night vision goggles. 
Some people might sit in a corner and whimper but not Starling -- with 
guts and determination she kills him and rescues his final victim.<br><br>7. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) "Spartacus"<br>(Stanley Kubrick, 1960)<br><br>Spartacus
has never been free. He is born a slave and trained to be a gladiator 
but he revolts and leads a slave uprising in Italy. His rebellion is 
extraordinary successful -- the army numbers thousands and marches on 
Rome. It is defeated in the end and Spartacus is crucified. But he dies 
unafraid because he knows it means his son will grow up a free man. In 
the fight for his family\'s freedom he is a one man force for change.<br><br>6. Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), \'\'Dirty Harry\'\'<br>(Don Siegel, 1971)<br><br>Rules
don\'t mean much to this alienated San Francisco cop when he\'s out 
hunting dangerous criminals. His methods are edgy but his attitude just 
seems to highlight the failings of the legal system and the weakness of 
his superiors. The only thing he trusts is his .44 Magnum revolver and 
when cocks it at an unlucky robber and asks: "Do ya feel lucky. Well, do
ya punk?" it\'s clear why this laconic anti-hero has had such a strong 
influence on pop culture.<br><br>5. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) "The Bourne Ultimatum"<br>(Paul Greengrass, 2007)<br><br>Bourne
is a highly trained killer suffering amnesia who the CIA just can\'t get
rid of. Not only does he fight off their best assassins better than 
Bruce Lee could, he has an impressive knack for improvising weapons from
whatever he can lay his hands on -- a hardback book, a brass 
candlestick, even a biro. A David and Goliath for the 21st century.<br><br>4. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) "Raiders of the Lost Ark"<br>(Stephen Spielberg, 1981)<br><br>Mostly
he\'s a quiet-living archaeology professor but once in a while fate 
conspires to make Indy pick up his dented fedora and bullwhip and rescue
a priceless relic from enemy hands. Not a nail-biting moment goes by 
without him getting into one scrape or another but aided by sardonic 
one-liners and a great left hook he always triumphs in the end. Indy is 
no superhero -- just the hero we\'d all like to be.<br><br>3. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) "Aliens"<br>(James Cameron, 1986)<br><br>"Get
away from her, you bitch!" spits Ripley distracting the huge alien and 
allowing Newt, the child she has saved from the infested planet to 
escape. She\'s female but a she\'s a muscular warrior, soaked in sweat 
from from the gun-battle she\'s been waging on the terrible creatures. 
She\'s like a furious lioness protecting her young -- and even the alien 
is no match for that.<br><br>2. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) "To Kill a Mockingbird"<br>(Robert Mulligan, 1962)<br><br>No
fighting necessary for this quiet Southern lawyer who defends a black 
man accused of raping a white woman, despite calls from the community 
not to. He is willing to do whatever it takes to uphold his values 
including standing up to a lynch mob who have come to kill his client. 
The widower somehow also finds the time to be a solid, wise father 
figure to his two children, Jem and Scout.<br><br>1. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) "Schindler\'s List"<br>(Stephen Spielberg, 1993)<br><br>Schindler
is a hard-drinking, womanizing, fully paid-up member of the Nazi party 
who wants nothing more than to make suitcases full of Reich marks out of
the war. Yet his innate humanity shines through and -- despite 
immediate risk to his own life -- he turns his factory into a haven for 
over 1,000 Jews who otherwise would probably have gone to their deaths 
at Auschwitz.</span>

<div>


<span>The French film "The Class," a frank tale about classroom 
life using real students and teachers at a junior high school, won top 
honors Sunday at the Cannes Film Festival.<br><br>Directed by Laurent 
Cantet, "The Class" ("Entre les Murs") was the first French film to win 
the main prize, the Palme d\'Or, at Cannes since "Under Satan\'s Sun" in 
1987. The docudrama was shot in a raw, improvisational style to 
chronicle the drama that unfolds over one school year.<br><br>The win was a unanimous decision among the nine-member Cannes jury, said Sean Penn, who headed the panel.<br><br>"The
movie that we wanted to make had to resemble French society, had to be 
multifaceted, a bit teeming, complex, and had to sometimes portray 
frictions that the film didn\'t try to erase," Cantet said.<br><br>Italian
films won the second-place grand prize and third-place jury prize. 
Matteo Garrone\'s "Gomorrah," a study of the criminal underworld in 
Naples, took the grand prize, while Paolo Sorrentino\'s "Il Divo," a 
lively portrait of former Premier Giulio Andreotti, won the jury award.<br><br>Benicio
Del Toro won Cannes\' best-actor prize for "Che," Steven Soderbergh\'s 
four-hour-plus epic about Latin American revolutionary Che Guevara. 
Presented as two films, "Che" follows Guevara and Fidel Castro\'s 
triumphant guerrilla campaign to overthrow Cuba\'s government in the late
1950s and Guevara\'s downfall and execution after trying to foment a 
similar rebellion in Bolivia in the 1960s.<br><br>Del Toro, who co-starred in Penn\'s "21 Grams," also won in a unanimous jury vote, Penn said.<br>"I\'d
like to dedicate this to the man himself, Che Guevara," said Del Toro. 
He also thanked Soderbergh, "who got up every day, forced me to this. 
... He was there pushing it, and he pushed all of us."<br><br>Soderbergh directed Del Toro to the supporting-actor Oscar for 2000\'s "Traffic."<br><br>Sandra
Corveloni was chosen as best actress for "Linha de Passe," in which she
plays the mother of four brothers struggling to make better lives for 
themselves in a Brazilian slum. It was her first role in a feature film.<br><br>Turkish
filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan was named best director for "Three 
Monkeys," which centers on a father who takes the rap for his employer\'s
crime in exchange for financial support for his wife and son, only to 
have the scheme backfire amid bitter repercussions.<br><br>Belgian 
siblings Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, two-time winners of the Palme 
d\'Or, received the screenplay prize for "Lorna\'s Silence," about an 
immigrant woman who enters a sham marriage to gain Belgian citizenship.<br><br>The
prize for a film by a first-time director went to British filmmaker 
Steve McQueen\'s "Hunger," set at a Northern Ireland prison where IRA 
volunteer Bobby Sands and other inmates seeking Irish independence 
staged a hunger strike in 1981.<br><br>The Cannes jury awarded special 
prizes to Clint Eastwood, who directed the competition film 
"Changeling," and Catherine Deneuve, who appeared in two films at Cannes
this year.<br><br>Eastwood was shut out for key prizes with "Changeling," his warmly received missing-child drama starring Angelina Jolie.<br><br>Eastwood,
who delivered two best-picture and director Academy Award recipients 
with "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby," has never won top honors at
Cannes after five times in competition there since 1985.<br><br>Jury 
president Penn won the best-actor Oscar for Eastwood\'s "Mystic River," 
which was shut out for prizes at Cannes five years ago.<br><br>"There 
was a field of such powerful, emotional, moving movies, performances. 
There was so many times that we thought, it just can\'t get better," Penn
said.<br><br>Critics judged the Cannes lineup more harshly, however. 
While Cannes presented few outright bombs this time, critics found the 
films a bit tepid.<br><br>Last year\'s competition included such films as
Joel and Ethan Coen\'s "No Country for Old Men," which went on to win 
the best-picture Academy Award, and Marjane Satrapi and Vincent 
Paronnaud\'s animated coming-of-age tale "Persepolis," which was 
nominated for the animation Oscar.<br><br>A film from Kazakhstan, Sergey
Dvortsevoy\'s "Tulpan," won a secondary competition called "Un Certain 
Regard." "Tulpan" is the story of an aspiring shepherd on the isolated 
Kazakh steppes who must wed before he can enter his chosen trade but is 
refused by the only prospective bride because she thinks his ears are 
too big.<br><br>Bosnian director Aida Begic\'s "Snow," a drama about 
villagers struggling with the decision to leave their war-ravaged town, 
won top honors in another Cannes competition overseen by critics.<br><br>After
the awards ceremony, the festival closed with the premiere of Barry 
Levinson\'s "What Just Happened?", starring Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis 
and Penn in the tale of a fading Hollywood producer trying to rejuvenate
his career amid personal and professional crises.<br><br>"What Just Happened?" came full circle: A year ago, Levinson and his collaborators were at Cannes filming scenes for the movie.</span>

<span>Fur might be a politically incorrect fashion statement on the
red carpet at the world\'s most-prestigious film festival. Not when 
you\'re the star of a movie called "Kung Fu Panda," though.<br><br>DreamWorks
Animation, whose past Cannes entries include the first two "Shrek" 
flicks and "Over the Hedge," put its adorable martial-arts hero 
alongside the festival\'s highbrow cinema entries Thursday with the 
premiere of the action comedy whose voice cast includes Jack Black, 
Angelina Jolie and Dustin Hoffman.<br><br>"Being an official selection 
of the Cannes Film Festival is the Good Housekeeping seal of approval," 
said Jeffrey Katzenberg, DreamWorks\' animation mastermind. "And it\'s 
particularly unique when it\'s a broad commercial movie as opposed to an 
art film. There\'s tremendous, tremendous value to that."<br><br>DreamWorks
uses Cannes as a launch-point for its movies, through screenings and 
clever stunts to catch the fancy of hordes of reporters, photographers 
and camera crews.<br><br>Black, who joined "Shark Tale" co-stars Jolie 
and Will Smith for a ride in the Mediterranean aboard an inflatable 
shark at the 2004 festival, this time paraded on a pier among 40 people 
in giant panda suits the day before the movie\'s Cannes premiere.<br><br>While
Black hammed it up with some kung fu poses, he wisecracked that the 
incessant camera flashes could go a long way to solving the energy 
crunch.<br><br>"If you harnessed all that electricity, it would probably
be enough to take a small unmanned ship to the moon and back," Black 
said. "It\'s got to be 1.21 gigawatts of light flashes. It\'s just going 
to be sick. Do we really need that many pictures? Where are all those 
photos going?"<br><br>Black provides the voice of Po, a panda in ancient
China who idolizes his country\'s martial-arts heroes but is too slow 
and clumsy to emulate their moves, stuck instead toiling in his family\'s
noodle shop. A twist of fate lands Po under the tutelage of a revered 
kung fu master (Hoffman), who must train the klutzy panda to battle an 
evil snow leopard (Ian McShane) intent on marauding and vengeance.<br><br>Po\'s
allies include a tiger (Jolie), a viper (Lucy Liu) and a monkey (Jackie
Chan), whose graceful martial-arts skills put the lumbering panda to 
shame.<br><br>"There\'s a concept which everybody responds to, the idea 
of this sort of soft, cuddly thing having to do this extremely active, 
athletic thing," said John Stevenson, who co-directed "Kung Fu Panda" 
with Mark Osborne.<br><br>"We saw the potential of this being the 
archetypal hero\'s journey that has been done millions of times, but we 
could actually do the most extreme hero\'s journey," Osborne said. "Take 
the most unlikely guy and bring him all the way to being a hero."<br><br>As
cartoon heroes go, Katzenberg thinks Po can go toe-to-toe with the 
animation world\'s box-office heavyweight, the irritable ogre Shrek.<br><br>"I
do think that Po the panda is going to give Shrek a run for his money, 
because I think that Po in a very different way is without question the 
most lovable character we\'ve ever created," Katzenberg said. "Shrek\'s an
anti-hero hero. Po is an unlikely hero. He is more in tune with what we
are ourselves. He actually has to find the hero within, and I think we 
all have a hero within us.<br><br>"So it\'s just very relatable to find 
this kind of average guy who\'s working in his dad\'s noodle restaurant 
suddenly have an ambitious fantasy to be something great, only to learn 
that being the best version of yourself is greatness."<br><br>"Kung Fu Panda" debuts in U.S. theaters June 6.</span>

<div>


<span>Early on in the new "Sex and the City" film -- and don\'t 
worry, we\'re not spoiling the plot here -- Carrie and longtime love Mr. 
Big are in bed together.<br><br>A passionate interlude? Nah, they\'re just reading. Except they both need glasses, and there\'s only one pair.<br><br>Sharing reading glasses in bed? These two, who fogged up the small screen with their sexual chemistry during the TV series?<br><br>Yes, and that small moment is a sweet acknowledgment that they\'ve both aged.<br><br>As, of course, have we.<br><br>The
series may be alive and well on TBS reruns. But it\'s been a full decade
since "Sex and the City" premiered on HBO, bringing us sex columnist 
Carrie, her three gal pals, and their lustful urban quest for love, good
sex and even better clothes.<br><br>That means these 30-somethings who 
spent six seasons drinking and trysting with abandon are now 
40-somethings, with a couple characters even flirting with 50. And 
cynics are asking: Can they pull this off? How does "Sex and the City" 
get around the age issue?<br><br>In interviews with The Associated Press
over the weekend, the cast answered that question unanimously: It 
doesn\'t. Age is not avoided here. It is embraced and even savored, like,
well, a nice, cool Cosmopolitan.<br><br>"When we started cobbling 
together the movie, we knew there was only one road we could take," said
Sarah Jessica Parker, who stars as Carrie and co-produced the film.<br><br>"You
cannot pretend we\'re 32, still running around New York drinking with 
liberty and looking for interesting sexual partnerships. It would have 
been vulgar. None of us wanted to do that."<br><br>And so the film 
begins not where the series left off four years ago, but in the present.
Carrie, now in her early 40s, is now a contributing editor to Vogue and
a best-selling author.<br><br>She\'s also got more money, and she\'s got 
Big, who, you may recall, flew to Paris in the series finale to rescue 
her from a bad relationship. Now they\'re in a happy place, and if you\'ve
seen the trailer, you know there are wedding plans afoot and a pretty 
amazing dress. InStyle: See Sex and the City fashions<br><br>But you can
tell things are going to be difficult, even sad. It\'s a far cry from 
the story producers originally planned to tell four years ago, when the 
project stalled, at least partly because of reported demands by Kim 
Cattrall, who plays Samantha, for more money and creative control.<br><br>"The
movie we were going to make was totally different," said Parker, 43. 
"It was a romp, kind of like those Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road movies.
But four years have passed, and there\'s just a lot more time invested 
in all these relationships."<br><br>That includes the ties between the 
women, said Cynthia Nixon, aka Miranda, the high-strung, hardworking 
lawyer who is at a breaking point when the movie begins.<br><br>"We were
all aware, partly because of the big screen but also because we\'re 
older, that there has to be a maturity there with the way we confront 
problems," Nixon said. "So when Miranda and Carrie fight, they take a 
little distance and try and work it out."<br><br>Maturity can be seen in
the clothes as well. "Were we still wearing these crazy outfits from 10
years ago, that would look wildly inappropriate," Nixon mused. But 
relax, fashionistas: Fabulous clothes still have their place.<br><br>"We
do have fantastic clothes and shoes, that hasn\'t changed," noted 
Kristin Davis, who plays Charlotte, the Park Avenue socialite who\'s 
found domestic contentment with her good-natured husband, Harry, and 
their adopted Chinese daughter. "But we couldn\'t pretend that time 
didn\'t pass. Our point is to tell it like it is."<br><br>The best 
example of that is Cattrall\'s Samantha Jones, whose frank expressions of
her lusty desires always made her character seem larger than life. But 
Samantha also suffered the worst hardship of all the women: breast 
cancer, in the show\'s last season.<br><br>Cattrall is 51, and in the 
series Samantha rarely spoke of her own age. In the film, her age is 
mentioned and even celebrated, in a poignant way.<br><br>"For a 
Hollywood movie that\'s extraordinary," said Cattrall. "But I think it\'s 
the way the show has always been. Whether it\'s aging or sex or dating or
disease or 9/11, it\'s been met head on."<br><br>And Cattrall knows her 
performance is influenced by her own aging process. "A lot of things 
have happened in the last four years, and they haven\'t all been great," 
she said, referring to her divorce and her father\'s diagnosis of 
dementia. "And it shades what you do. It shades who you are."<br><br>With
nobody left to represent the younger set, Michael Patrick King, who 
directed and wrote the film (and co-produced it with Parker), brought in
Jennifer Hudson, the 26-year-old Oscar winner from "Dreamgirls," to 
play Carrie\'s tech-savvy assistant. Parker said the purpose of the new 
role is "to reflect what that time of life is all about, how you feel 
about love, and how simple it is then."<br><br>To Hudson, that makes 
sense. "Now there\'s another kind of character the audience can relate 
to," she said, also noting that she\'s the first major black character to
figure in the story.<br><br>Aging is not just a female process, of 
course, and Mr. Big, played by Chris Noth, has a little added gravitas 
now, perhaps a few gray hairs, and a more mature approach to romance (To
a point. This is Big, after all.) Noth, 53, seems thrilled that the 
film is presenting a set of mature characters.<br><br>"Where did the 
notion come from that the lives of adults are less interesting than the 
lives of those under 30?" he asked. "I actually think the movie has MORE
relevance. I think the girls look better. And I\'m just happy that we 
have some adult entertainment here.<br><br>"We\'ve strayed so far in our culture, it\'s like, you know, can kiddie time be over?"</span>

<div>


<span>When Gwyneth Paltrow made the rounds to promote "Iron Man," 
the buzz wasn\'t about the Oscar winner\'s return to the screen after an 
extended hiatus. It wasn\'t about the curious casting of a serious 
actress as a superhero\'s secretary.<br><br>It was about her shoes.<br><br>Paltrow\'s
sky-high stilettos, shoulder-length curls and up-to-there skirts were 
seen as a sign: She\'s shedding her stay-at-home mom sweat pants and is 
ready to reclaim her throne in the celebrity pantheon.<br><br>"In 
England, there were pages in the newspaper on my various footwear," she 
says. "I think there\'s some excitement that I\'m back in high heels and, 
you know, being glamorous."<br><br>She says this while decked out in 
another pair of killer pumps, with no sense of surprise that a change of
clothing could set off a minor tempest of speculation about her life.<br><br>Paltrow
has what might be called a conflicted relationship with Hollywood. Even
when she\'s not working, she\'s tailed by paparazzi and scrutinized for 
her fashion, her mothering and her marriage to a famous rock star, 
Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.<br><br>That union is one she works hard 
to keep private. She calls the latest gossip about the state of her 
marriage, fueled by her daring outfits and the couple\'s refusal to 
appear on red carpets together, "hilarious."<br><br>The fascination with
her private life has been frustrating, but also meant she lost little 
luster in the few years that she\'s focused on her daughter Apple, 4, and
son Moses, 2.<br><br>"There were some days where I thought, after I had
my son and I couldn\'t lose the weight and I was in sweat pants and I 
was depressed and I was thinking, you know, will I ever be able to go 
back? Will they take me back?" she said.<br><br>Those feelings were exacerbated by the postpartum depression she says she experienced after the birth of her son.<br><br>She
left Hollywood a few years earlier following the death of her father, 
director Bruce Paltrow, with the feeling that she had already finished 
what she set out to accomplish. She\'d done star turns in critically 
acclaimed movies. She\'d won an Academy Award for "Shakespeare in Love." 
She\'d been the "it" girl on the arms of Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck.<br><br>It was time for her to focus on her family.<br><br>"You
know, they change so quickly and the idea of somebody else being there 
when they do their first this or say their first that is just like, it 
makes me die," she says.<br><br>Her kids know her only as Mommy. "They\'ve never seen me on-screen or anything. They have no idea."<br><br>But Hollywood years can be like dog years -- three of them offscreen can seem like a decade, enough to torpedo a star\'s career.<br><br>"I
think especially in my own business it confounded people that I was 
willing to walk away from that and to lose my place on the A-list and 
say, it\'s not important to me right now in my life," she says.<br><br>"Iron
Man" marks her big comeback after small parts in "Running With 
Scissors" and her brother\'s film, "The Good Night." In the first of the 
summer blockbusters, she joins an all-star cast of Robert Downey Jr., 
Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and director Jon Favreau. With a $100 
million-plus opening weekend, it\'s become the first blockbuster of the 
summer.<br><br>"As soon as we heard she was interested, we put her in 
the movie," Favreau says. "Gwyneth is refined, classy, smart and mature.
She seemed a good pairing for Robert (Downey Jr.). It was a very quick 
decision."<br><br>For Paltrow, the supporting role of Pepper Potts, the 
dutiful assistant and possible love interest, was a good transition, 
allowing her to work two or three days a week while the rest of the cast
went off to blow things up in the desert.<br><br>She spent time with 
her children at the family house in California that her mother, actress 
Blythe Danner, subsequently sold. "It was just sort of reliving my own 
childhood again but with them, and it was just kind of a magical time."<br><br>Working with Downey was also invigorating.<br><br>"He
would come into the trailer in the morning when we were going to read 
the scene and he would literally ball up the script and throw it against
the wall and say, \'This sucks, let\'s start over,\' " she says. "So it 
was like, \'OK! Well! What are we going to do today?\'"<br><br>Downey 
insists there were no hurt feelings about the give-and-take: "I don\'t 
think \'genius\' and \'superhero script\' belong in the same sentence," he 
says.<br><br>Both stars have indicated they are open to sequels -- and Marvel has already announced that "Iron Man 2" is slated for 2010.<br><br>So
Paltrow is back, but on her terms. After shooting the upcoming "Two 
Lovers" with Joaquin Phoenix, she\'s taking the rest of the spring and 
summer off.<br><br>"I don\'t think I could go back to ever doing three, 
four, five movies a year. There\'s just no way. There\'s no way," she 
says. "Maybe when they\'re in college. But by that point no one will want
me in a movie anymore, probably."</span>

<span>Ian McKellen will again take up the robes of Gandalf the

magazine\'s Web site quoted McKellen as saying that director Guillermo

confirmed that I would be reprising the role," the magazine quoted 
McKellen as saying. "Obviously, it\'s not a part that you turn down, I 
loved playing Gandalf."<br><br>McKellen\'s sonorous interpretation of 
Gandalf in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy delighted fans and critics, 
earning him an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor.<br><br>The 68-year-old British actor previously told The Associated Press that he would hate to see anyone else play the role.<br><br>The

<span>Academy Award-winning director Sydney Pollack, who achieved 
critical acclaim with the period drama "Out of Africa" and the romantic 
comedy "Tootsie," died of cancer Monday, his agent told CNN.<br><br>Pollack,
73, died at his home in Los Angeles. He was surrounded by his wife of 
nearly 50 years, Claire Griswold, their two daughters, Rebecca and 
Rachel, and his brother, Bernie, agent Leslee Dart said. Their only son 
Steven died in a plane crash in 1993.<br><br>Pollack, who often appeared
on the screen himself, worked with and gained the respect of 
Hollywood\'s best actors in a long career that reached prominence in the 
1970s and 1980s, according to the Associated Press.<br><br>"Sydney made 
the world a little better, movies a little better and even dinner a 
little better. A tip of the hat to a class act," actor George Clooney 
said in a statement issued by his publicist, the Associated Press 
reported.<br><br>Last fall, Pollack played Marty Bach opposite Clooney 
in "Michael Clayton," a drama that examines the life of a fixer for 
lawyers. The film, which Pollack co-produced, received seven Oscar 
nominations, including best picture and a best actor nod for Clooney, 
according to the Associated Press.<br><br>Pollack was no stranger to the
Academy Awards. In 1986, "Out of Africa," a romantic epic of a woman\'s 
passion set against the landscape of colonial Kenya, captured seven 
Oscars, including best director, The Associated Press reported.<br><br>In
addition to directing "Out of Africa," "Tootsie," "The Way We Were," 
and a host of other Oscar-nominated films, he appeared in Stanley 
Kubrick\'s "Eyes Wide Shut," Woody Allen\'s "Husbands and Wives," and his 
own "The Electric Horseman."<br><br>He also produced nearly 50 films, 
including 1981\'s "Absence of Malice," which starred Paul Newman and 
Sally Field, and 1999\'s "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which starred Matt 
Damon.<br><br>Though he had been working until recently -- his show 
"Recount" premiered Sunday night on HBO -- he had been in a lot of pain 
and did not watch it, Dart said.<br><br>Doctors never were able to determine the primary source of the cancer, she said.<br><br>Services will be private, she said.</span>

<div>


<span>(CNN) -- It\'s been a long, long time since the last "last" 
time: When Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr. rode off into the sunset in May
1989, courtesy of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," the Berlin Wall
was still standing, George H.W. Bush was only four months into his 
presidency, and Harrison Ford was just a young whippersnapper of 46.<br><br>Quite
why Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas -- three of the wealthiest 
men in Hollywood -- should feel the need to resurrect Indiana Jones at 
this late stage of the game is anybody\'s guess. The three men have a 
combined age of 191, but like many boomers, they\'re not ready for the 
rest home just yet, even if living in the past seems a strange way to 
show it.<br><br>The first Indiana Jones film, "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"
was already a nostalgia trip when it was released in 1981, a guileless 
celebration of the old-fashioned Saturday morning adventure serials that
were a staple for any kid growing up in the \'30s, \'40s and \'50s. That 
makes the new film, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal 
Skull," a throwback to a throwback.<br><br>But time is catching up with the series.<br><br>The
new film is set in 1957, enabling Ford to act his age (or something 
like it). But this is the outer edge of a time when America could still 
believe in the simple black-and-white morality Indiana represents. If 
the Nazis and the Reds couldn\'t finish him off, the \'60s surely would.<br><br>Still,
in some ways, the extra years suit Ford. Indiana has always been a 
surly old sourpuss, a pragmatic, world-weary hero in the classic WWII 
mold. Indy\'s fondness for griping is part of what makes him human. And 
when it comes to trading punches, cracking heads or disinterring the 
dead, Ford can still get it done. If he can\'t, his stunt double can.<br><br>The
movie opens in Nevada, where Dr. Jones is caught up in a daring raid on
Area 51 led by Soviet agent Irina Spalko, played by a Cate Blanchett in
a severe black bob, long black rubber gloves and a rapier. (It\'s a 
get-up so outrÃ©, even Joe Stalin would smile.) In a twist worthy of "The
Twilight Zone," Indy finds himself in an ersatz small town populated by
cardboard figures watching "Howdy Doody" -- a test site for an imminent
A-bomb explosion.<br><br>This bravura, breakneck opening immediately 
rekindles the old magic: the mixture of bravado and wit with action 
sequences that keep piling on layer upon layer of peril. Unfortunately, 
this is also the high point of the movie, or close to it.<br><br>Indiana\'s
brush with the Reds makes him a person of interest to the FBI just 
after the height of the McCarthy period, a quick, passing nod toward a 
post-9/11 sensibility that the movie runs away from almost as 
desperately as Indy scrambles from an army of man-eating ants. At this 
point, screenwriter David Koepp in effect starts the story all over 
again, this time with Brylcreemed biker Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) 
making a clumsy pitch about rescuing his mom from kidnappers in South 
America.<br><br>That, and something about a legendary crystal skull, get
Indiana Jones\' juices churning, and suddenly the old professor and the 
young tough are off on an adventure.<br><br>This outlandish hokum 
doesn\'t bear close scrutiny, so it\'s probably just as well Dr. Jones is 
not one for introspection. He does his thinking on his feet, and so does
Spielberg, who sometimes seems to be directing this with one eye on the
exit signs.<br><br>It is good to see Karen Allen back as Marion 
Ravenwood, easily the pick of Indiana\'s women. She lends the enterprise 
some heart that is sorely lacking elsewhere. It\'s just a pity Koepp 
can\'t find more for her to do. (Ray Winstone, as an Indy colleague, is 
also poorly used.)<br><br>A long jungle chase is another bona fide 
highlight, but Spielberg and Lucas misjudge the film\'s extravagant CGI 
climax; I won\'t spoil it here, but it feels alien to Indy\'s world. Let\'s
just say we have seen this before, from Spielberg himself, and done 
better, too.<br><br>"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"
has enough going for it to secure the bronze medal in the series and 
even compete for the silver, but "The Last Crusade" was a more graceful 
farewell. Indeed, the prospect of a revived series -- either with Ford 
or LaBeouf in the driver\'s seat -- isn\'t especially enticing. "The 
Adventures of Mutt Williams," anyone?</span>

<div>


<span>Horton the Elephant struggles to protect a microscopic community from his neighbors who refuse to believe it exists.<br><br>If
you want the short version of my review of Horton Hears a Who!, the 
latest Dr. Seuss book to be adapted for the big screen, it is as 
follows: I loved this movie, my kids loved this movie, Mr. Wonderful 
loved this movie, and everyone else in the packed theater screening 
seemed to love this movie! If you are interested in hearing why we loved
Horton, the story of an elephant determined to find a safe haven for a 
community of tiny people (a.k.a, Whos) that live on a speck of dust and 
that no one else believes exists, read on...<br><br>When I was young my 
older brother enjoyed tormenting me in a number of ways. His favorite 
method involved coming into my room after I was asleep, late at night, 
turning on my overhead light and asking me, "Hey, Sue, what if we are 
all tiny specks living on a tiny world contained in a giantâ€™s 
fingernail? What happens when the giant cuts his nails?" When he was 
sure I was awake and his question had registered, he would leave. 
Without turning the lights off. Watching Horton Hears a Who! forcibly 
reminded me of those late nights and allowed me to stop feeling quite so
foolish for having pondered his questions.<br><br>The animation and 
color in this picture are wonderful. The colors are bright and the 
characters look like Dr. Seuss drawings, not like someone elseâ€™s 
interpretation of Dr. Seuss characters. That visual integrity, 
particularly when presenting a style so deeply ingrained in our 
collective, cultural experience, is the key to hooking viewers from the 
very first moments, and this film successfully meets that challenge. The
only real departures from Seuss-vision, if you will, accompany Hortonâ€™s
flights of imagination, the most memorable of which resembles Japanese 
anime, complete with lips moving out of synch with the dialogue, which 
my kids found quite amusing.<br><br>Additionally, Horton (Jim Carrey, 
whose talents are put to good use here) is one of the most delightful 
characters, animated or otherwise, I can think of in recent movie 
history. His motto, "an elephant is faithful 100%" dovetails nicely with
his firm and oft-repeated conviction that "a personâ€™s a person, no 
matter how smallâ€ and it is this combination that both makes Horton a 
dependable friend and drives the film. It is, perhaps, a minor miracle 
that despite Hortonâ€™s determination and devotion to his ideals, even in 
the face of personal danger, intense social pressure and the threat of 
expulsion from his jungle home, he never becomes preachy or 
insufferable. Heâ€™s just doing what he does, and a big part of what he 
does involves using his imagination and retaining his sense of humor.<br><br>After
a brow beating by the self-appointed jungle mayor, a "sour kangaroo" 
(excellently voiced by Carol Burnett) hell-bent on thwarting Horton and 
putting the kibosh on imagination in general, Horton moseys away 
wondering about her admonition to follow her instructions "ASAP." His 
resolution of that expressionâ€™s meaning is likely, I think, to become 
part of our family vernacular; he decides it means "act swiftly awesome 
pachyderm." It is funny and accurate, because Horton is indeed 
"awesome."<br><br>Last, but not least, (remember, "a personâ€™s a person, 
no matter how smallâ€) we loved Whoville and its Mayor, Ned (Steve 
Carell, another perfect bit of casting). Ned and his wife Sally have 96 
daughters and one son named Jojo (perhaps the most interesting Who of 
all), "who all share a bathroom." Talk about sympathetic characters! Ned
loves his brood and makes sure they all get at least one minute of his 
time each day. He loves his job; it has been in the family for 
generations. He loves Whoville, and on the surface it seems a pretty 
idyllic place, but he canâ€™t shake the feeling, or ignore the mounting 
evidence, that something is horribly wrong. Did I already mention heâ€™s a
sympathetic character? Like Horton, Ned is faced with a constituency 
that doesnâ€™t want to hear, and certainly doesnâ€™t believe, that, perhaps,
all is not as it seems.<br><br>Because Horton Hears a Who! is a Dr. 
Seuss story, it has a moral and the good guys, Horton and Ned, prevail. 
But this is also a movie version of Dr. Seuss, so getting there takes a 
while. Because it is a really good movie adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book,
the experience is, like Horton, awesome.</span>

<div>


<span>Never in a million years would have I imagined that what I 
saw tonight would have sprung from the minds of those that brought it to
me.<br><br>When one thinks of the off-kilter, sometimes very bizarre 
comedy of Michael Ian Black (a writer and performer on the television 
shows The State and Viva Variety) and the geek-centric, genius-level 
parody of Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), odds are youâ€™re 
not thinking that the two would work together to create a heartwarming, 
adorable romantic comedy about a man trying to prove himself to his 
ex-fiancee and his son by running and completing a marathon. But thatâ€™s 
exactly what Run Fatboy Run is. Neither weird nor coming within fifty 
miles of making a direct reference to another film, this seems to play 
outside the safety zones of both Pegg and Black. And yet together, under
the direction of TVâ€™s Ross (David Schwimmer â€“- donâ€™t pretend you didnâ€™t
know which Ross I was talking about), the result is a delightfully 
endearing piece of modern, mainstream, even somewhat predictable, 
comedy.<br><br>And I loved every minute.<br><br>It was no secret that 
Schwimmer was going to attempt to become the Jonathan Frakes of the 
Friends troupe, having directed a dozen different episodes of the 
long-running series. But unlike Frakes (who went from starring on and 
directing episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation to directing 
gawd-awful childrenâ€™s fare like Clockstoppers and Thunderbirds), 
Schwimmer comes out swinging with one hell of a directorial debut. Sure,
it isnâ€™t particularly cutting-edge or career redefining. Instead it 
plays to his strengths and to the audience most apt to seek out his 
work. Friends, after all, was a weekly episodic romantic comedy that 
only began to run out of steam once every permutation possible between 
the cast members had been played out. So Schwimmer took everything he 
learned on that long-running show and funneled that into a real 
crowd-pleaser of a comedy.<br><br>Rather than focusing upon the standard
boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-gets-girl back formula, Run Fatboy 
Run is entirely about the getting girl back portion of the film. As the 
film opens, Dennis (Simon Pegg) is leaving his pregnant fiancee at the 
altar. Cut to five years later and his life is in shambles. The love of 
his life has found someone else and his son might find himself with a 
new and more together father. So he envisions the only thing he can to 
win his family back â€“ run in the same marathon as his ex-fianceeâ€™s new 
suitor.<br><br>But as the film wears on, it becomes less about winning 
back the girl and more about winning her and their sonâ€™s respect. Even 
as it seems that he may never win her back, the film focuses upon the 
transformation taking place within Dennis as he realizes what heâ€™s 
really fighting for.<br><br>Sound like youâ€™ve heard it all before? Sure 
you have. In fact, watch this long enough and you can even guess the 
ending in a called shot that probably won\'t impress anyone you know. But
romantic comedies arenâ€™t about where you end up. Theyâ€™re entirely about
how you get there. And it is the how you get there that makes this 
something special. Here we have two comic talents (Black and Pegg) 
trying their hand at mainstream comedy (including gross-out jokes, 
swearing granny/youngster jokes, and a whole bevy of Jerky New Boyfriend
jokes) and in doing so shows you how theyâ€™re done. They donâ€™t try for 
the joke-a-minute formula. Instead they focus on solid, laugh out loud 
jokes that just plain work. And even if you donâ€™t laugh, they refuse to 
let you roll your eyes. It is razor sharp wit that doesnâ€™t require a 
razor sharp mind to enjoy it.<br><br>Thatâ€™s not to say that this movie 
aims low. Sure, itâ€™s more accessible than either of the writers is 
accustomed to and more along the lines of what Schwimmer is good at, but
it hits everything that it aims for. It is careful, well-crafted comedy
that will appeal to a broad audience. But it doesnâ€™t reinvent the 
wheel. If youâ€™re the type of person looking for something new, you wonâ€™t
find it here. But it had the crowd cheering as much as they were 
laughing, and that\'s never a bad thing. About as solid as a film like 
this can be, it comes pretty well recommended.</span>

<div>


<span>A few things have changed since the first Chronicles of 
Narnia film arrived on the scene. In the sequel, Prince Caspian, the 
principal actors are a little older and more proficient.<br><br>The 
director, Andrew Adamson, seems more confident; the action scenes are 
smoother and more polished. The Christian allegories are not as awkward 
and heavy-handed.<br><br>It\'s a better movie all around, though still 
not a great one. Like its predecessor, it is plot-heavy, with very 
little attention paid to characterization. You\'ll recall that there are 
four siblings at the center -- and three of them come off as total 
ciphers here. It wasn\'t until I re-read my review of the first film that
I remembered that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) used to be rebellious. If he 
still is, there\'s little sign of it. If he isn\'t anymore, then what is 
he instead?<br><br>The Pevensie child who does not get the short shrift 
is the oldest, Peter (William Moseley), who returns to Narnia with his 
siblings when they are summoned by a distress call. It\'s been a year for
them, but several centuries in Narnia-time, and a usurping family has 
stolen the throne and forced all the Narnian magical creatures into 
hiding in the forest. The ruling family\'s teenage Prince Caspian (Ben 
Barnes) is now hiding, too, because his uncle, the evil King Miraz 
(Sergio Castellitto), having finally produced a male heir for himself, 
has no reason to let Caspian keep living. Miraz is leading the army into
the forest to find and kill Caspian (and any Narnians that get in the 
way); Caspian and the Pevensie kids must rally the troops, fight back, 
and at last reclaim the throne.<br><br>Peter, now more serious and 
grown-up than the last time we saw him, readily adopts his previous 
position as rightful king of Narnia and deeply considers the options 
that lie before him. Caspian, meanwhile, is more hotheaded and emotional
-- which is understandable, considering his uncle wants to kill him -- 
and this leads to recklessness. It also leads, inevitably, to Peter\'s 
sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) developing a crush on Caspian, in a 
subplot so underdeveloped that it is an insult to subplots.<br><br>Meanwhile,
young Lucy (Georgie Henley) insists that Aslan, the mighty Jesus-lion, 
will yet return and save the day. Her siblings do not share her faith. 
Lucy even claims to have glimpsed Aslan here and there. When Peter asks 
why he didn\'t see him, Lucy says, "Maybe you weren\'t looking." This is 
fraught with spiritual import. In fact, everything with Lucy is fraught 
that way.<br><br>Among the new characters the young people encounter are
dwarfs named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and Nikabrik (Warwick Davis), 
plus a mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard) whose small stature has given him a
persecution complex. No one takes a talking mouse seriously, even if he
does have a sword.<br><br>Light touches like that abound in the film, 
but there is ample darkness, too. Its PG rating represents an astounding
lapse in judgment on the part of the MPAA, as the film is rife with 
stabbing, slicing, and death. Someone\'s head gets chopped off. Lots of 
good creatures are slain while others look on, powerless to help. Very 
little blood is actually shown, but still, the slaughter is endless. (I 
don\'t hold the faulty rating against the film itself, of course. I point
it out merely as a reminder for parents with young children.)<br><br>The
battle scenes are well orchestrated and often thrilling. There is also a
chilling sequence where someone contemplates a turn to dark magic, and 
two horrific creatures, one wolflike and one resembling a ghastly 
bird-headed woman, appear. Moments like that give the film some weight, 
particularly insofar as they give the characters something complicated 
to think about.<br><br>Predictably, the film\'s running time -- almost 2 
1/2 hours -- feels too long, especially given the story\'s basic 
simplicity. And ultimately, the only way the film makes sense is if it\'s
read as a Christian allegory. Taken strictly at face value, it\'s 
nonsensical: If Aslan is all-powerful, why doesn\'t he arrive sooner and 
defeat the bad guys single-handedly? What makes anyone think he\'s going 
to come back at all? Why does he come back when he does? What, exactly, 
is Aslan\'s connection to everyone? Is he their king? Their god? Their 
buddy? These questions are easily answered if you replace "Aslan" with 
"Jesus" and fill in the biblical blanks, but that limits the movie\'s 
potential reach. Someone with no knowledge of Christian theology would 
be baffled by the movie\'s strange narrative and leo ex machina ending.<br><br>Of
course, the only people with no complex knowledge of Christian theology
who are likely to see the film are young children, and they won\'t care 
about the story\'s structural flaws. It\'s the grown-ups who might feel 
slightly underwhelmed by it all, though they\'ll likely be moderately 
entertained by the action and adventure.</span>

<div>


<span>Speed Racer looks really good. I\'ll give them that. The story
wasn\'t really for me but there was nothing particularly wrong with it 
either.<br><br>It\'s just a straightforward kid\'s movie with the best darned effects this side of Space Mountain.<br><br>Now
for the caveats portion of our review. I\'ve seen a few episodes of 
Speed Racer on Cartoon Network, but I remember about 45 seconds total of
the show. The monkey stands out. So this puppy might have been laced 
with in-jokes and homages all over the place that the "true" fans will 
love in a big way. If so, I\'m happy for them; but that was not my 
experience. The other caveat is that, by and large, PG films are not for
me. Just the way I\'m wired, I suppose.<br><br>The Speed Racer is played
capably by Emile Hirsch. The film starts with him as a wee lad hanging 
out with his big brother Rex Racer, a professional racer on the WRL 
circuit. The film flashes forward and then back again quite a bit during
the initial stages (the film is over two hours, by the way). 
Essentially, Speed Racer, along with Pops (John Goodman), Trixie 
(Christina Ricci), Mom (Susan Sarandon), the kid brother, and monkey, 
gets embroiled in a face-off against the corporate powers that be. Three
major races break up the movie and provide a bit of adult relief from 
the threadbare plot.<br><br>Logically, everything makes sense here. The 
villains are clear and their motivations apparent -- the family and 
Speed are gallant and determined in their efforts to make theirs the 
best racing team on the circuit. Matthew Fox takes a spin as Racer X, 
the man with shadowy intentions and phenomenal driving moves. The whole 
film feels a bit noir in terms of tone, but the blaring effects don\'t 
allow for much introspection overall. This would be a difficult film to 
hate but not a difficult film to be a bit bored by. Again, and it bears 
repeating as this one carries the Wachowski brothers\' (The Matrix, V for
Vendetta) signature; this is a film for those not looking for anything 
too intellectually challenging.<br><br>I would highly recommend Speed 
Racer for families seeking a visual treat. I\'m less than optimistic that
this will appeal to adults who weren\'t big fans of the original. It 
doesn\'t strike me as a date movie either: though Ricci and Hirsch have 
nice chemistry, the PG factor dulls it down a bit. However, I will say

<span>It just takes smart shopping to assemble a do-it-yourself speaker system<br><br>iPod
owners have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to choosing a 
speaker system for their music player. I should knowâ€”over the past few 
years, Iâ€™ve reviewed many of these accessories, which typically combine 
an iPod dock, an amplifier, speakers, and a remote control. And while 
many iPod speaker systems make considerable compromises between sound 
quality, size, and convenience, some are quite impressive. When Iâ€™ve 
reviewed the best of these productsâ€”take Klipschâ€™s $400 iFi or Jamoâ€™s 
$400 i300 as examplesâ€”I\'ve often noted that users would be hard-pressed 
to put together a system on their own that sounds better for the same 
amount of money.<br><br>But that got me thinking: how difficult would 
doing so be? With some smart shopping, could you create a systemâ€”an 
amplifier, an iPod dock with remote, and speakersâ€”that competes on both 
price and performance with the best systems specifically made for the 
iPod?<br><br>I decided to find out. I searched for components to make my
own iPod speaker system, with the ultimate goal being a noticeable 
upgrade in sound quality over good iPod speaker systems in the same 
price range (which means connecting an iPod dock to a $300 â€œbookshelf 
stereoâ€ with mediocre sound quality wouldnâ€™t cut it).<br><br>Why go 
through the trouble? After all, if there are already good systems out 
there for $300 to $400, why not just plunk down your money and start 
listening instead of going to the trouble of rounding up the parts 
yourself? For starters, a system with separate speakers has the 
potential to sound better than an all-in-one box. Second, by buying the 
components separately, youâ€™re future-proofing your system: you can later
upgrade to a better amplifier, or a nice receiver, and even use the 
system for listening to CDs or radio. Apple could also make changes to 
future iPod models that render current iPod speaker systems obsolete; 
with a custom stereo, you can just buy a new dock instead of having to 
replace the whole thing. Finally, as an audio guy who also reviews iPod 
speakers, I simply wanted to see what was possible.<br><br>The ground rules<br><br>To truly replace a dedicated iPod speaker system, my build-it-yourself stereo had to meet several requirements:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
* iPod dock: A cradle that connects to an iPodâ€™s dock-connector port is
necessary for high-quality sound and the ability to control playback 
using a wireless remote. (See the next item.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remote control: A
wireless remote for controlling basic iPod playback 
(play/pause/back/forward) is a must. The capability to control volume 
level is a bonus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Good sound quality: If my DIY system wasnâ€™t 
going to sound as good as, or better than, whatâ€™s already out there, 
there was no point in pursuing this exercise. Thankfully, there are many
inexpensive speakers on the market that sound great. And, as I noted 
above, separate left/right speakers have some clear advantages over 
one-box systems: separate speakers can provide much better stereo 
separation and imaging than speakers confined to a one-piece box; you 
often get better-quality components; and you can place components where 
you want them or where they sound the bestâ€”you donâ€™t need a single, 
large â€œfootprintâ€ on your desk or dresser.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Itâ€™s also worth 
noting that a quality pair of standalone speakers will likely be with 
you long after an iPod speaker system has found its way onto CraigsList 
or the electronics-recycling pile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Relatively-compact size and 
decent appearance: With separate speakers, a DIY stereo is going to take
up more room than a desktop system, but I wanted to keep it small 
enough to fit on a desk, dresser, or counter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of 
appearance, while there are some inexpensive amplifiers that perform 
surprisingly well, including ones you can solder together yourself, many
are bulky and ugly. I didnâ€™t expect to be able to put something 
together that looked like B&amp;Wâ€™s $600 Zeppelin, but I hoped to create
a system that wouldnâ€™t look like something I built using parts from 
Radio Shack.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Reasonable price: Although there are iPod speaker 
systems out there that cost $4,000 (or more), many of our favoritesâ€”ones
that offer excellent sound quality and a good feature setâ€”are in the 
$300 to $400 range. So â€œaround $400â€ was my rough target price.</span>

said Wednesday it would update Office 2007 to allow users to save text,
spreadsheets and other documents in the Portable Document Format â€” as 
PDF files â€” and other non-Microsoft file formats, in addition to its own
Office Open XML format, known as OOXML.<br><br>The changes, due next 
year, would add the formats â€” including a competing standard called 
OpenDocument Format created by open source developers and used by IBM 
Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and others â€” as defaults consumers could 
choose from for saving all their documents.<br><br>Microsoft\'s 
announcement was the latest in a series of moves meant to show it has 
changed its ways and is no longer the same company whose anticompetitive
behavior provoked more than $2.63 billion in fines in the E.U.<br><br>Critics
have stayed skeptical of Microsoft\'s vows to make its software work 
better with rival programs, and European regulators opened two new 
Microsoft antitrust investigations in January, one related to the OOXML 
format.<br><br>"In its ongoing antitrust investigation concerning 
interoperability with Microsoft Office, the commission will investigate 
whether the announced support of ODF in Office leads to better 
interoperability," the European Union\'s executive arm said Thursday.<br><br>Critics
who support ODF say Microsoft is trying to supplant ODF and with OOXML 
and lock users into buying Office programs forever, stemming the threat 
of open source software eating into its market share.<br><br>Despite a 
chorus of complaints, OOXML was approved last month as an international 
standard, paving the way for it to be used by the IT departments of 
governments and large corporations.<br><br>Microsoft said Wednesday it continues to work with the open source community on an OOXML-ODF translator.<br><br>The

rival Symantec Corp.<br><br>McAfee Chief Executive Dave DeWalt said on 
Wednesday he aims to accelerate revenue growth in 2009 and 2010 beyond 
the company\'s target of mid-teens percentage growth for 2008.<br><br>Growth
should come through a combination of new products, partnerships with 
technology companies, and acquisitions like the 
$50-million-to-$350-million deals McAfee has made in the past, DeWalt 
said at the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in New 
York.<br><br>"We don\'t necessarily need to acquire large to do this. 
This is a strategy for us where acquiring technologies and building and 
partnering is clearly a path that we can create to grow the company to 
much more sizable than it is today," he said.<br><br>"We tend to do two 
to three acquisitions a year. We\'ve been consistent with that," said 
DeWalt, a sports enthusiast who competes in triathlons. "We continue to 
like to do what we call small and medium-sized acquisitions."<br><br>The
CEO, who has been with McAfee for about 14 months, said that security 
software has so far proven to be recession-proof because customers need 
to protect against viruses and data theft in rough times as much as when
the economy is strong.<br><br>But he cautioned that his company could see a fallout down the road from the economic slump in the United States.<br><br>"Am I nervous? Do I read the headlines too? Yes," he said.<br><br>Still, DeWalt noted that the company has posted three accelerating growth quarters in a row.<br><br>"We
certainly see \'09 and 2010 as very strong growth years for the company 
with a lot of the partnerships we set up, a lot of the model changes we 
had," DeWalt said. "Certainly, it\'s hard to forecast how the economy and
things will be; but certainly we put a lot of growth drivers in the 
business to really accelerate growth even more."<br><br>McAfee plans to introduce a variety of new products over the coming quarters to build new revenue streams.<br><br>One
area with great potential is protecting data centers that use 
virtualization technology to boost the efficiency of their servers and 
storage equipment, he said.<br><br>Products in these areas are in the 
works, including ones that will scan traffic before it is stored and 
scan data used by applications from giant German software company SAP

cellphones, but its role is increasing as more new Linux-based models 
reach the market, while Google Inc gave it a vote of confidence by using
it to build its Android platform on.<br><br>Nokia itself has used Linux
for years in its Internet tablets, large phone-like devices used to 
access Internet on the go, but lacking calling functionality. "We will 
expand that range, and we believe that the role of Linux will grow," 
said Nokia spokesman Kari Tuutti.<br><br>Linux is the most popular type 
of open source operating system which is available to the public to be 
used, revised and shared -- meaning it has a large developer community 
which could result in more attractive programs and lower costs for the

<span>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sybase Inc (SY.N) plans to soon start 
selling software that lets businesses securely distribute e-mail to the 
iPhone, which could help the popular device gain use among business 
clients.<br><br>The program for Apple Inc\'s (AAPL.O) iPhone will be 
released before the end of this year, John Chen said on Monday at the 
Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in New York. When 
asked to be more specific, he said, "It will be soon."<br><br>The new 
program lets workers use the iPhone to access their e-mail with the same
security safeguards that are currently available in products for use on
Treo smartphones from Palm Inc (PALM.O) and Research in Motion\'s 
(RIM.TO) BlackBerry, Chen said.<br><br>He said that Sybase is also 
working on similar software for Android, a new smartphone platform that 
Google Inc (GOOG.O) is developing with dozens of other companies.<br><br>The
new Sybase software programs will allow businesses to deliver e-mail to
several different types of phones, depending on which device a user 
carries, Chen said.<br><br>"It will be secure enterprise grade," Chen said. "It will let the IT guys manage it."<br><br>The
business software maker already sells software that companies can use 
to send e-mail using the BlackBerry, Treo and smartphones running on the
Symbian operating system as well as one for mobile devices from 
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).</span>

        'article_content' => 'New tab design will help organize average Facebook member\'s profile 
interface to minimize clutter, but there will likely be speed bumps 
along the way<br><br>Facebook\'s major overhaul of its core member 
profile pages is a risky but necessary move for the world\'s 
second-largest online social network, according to several developers of
popular applications for the site.<br><br>The move is risky because 
Facebook will alter the user interface significantly, which can clash 
against people\'s natural resistance to change and prompt them to 
complain.<br><br>In addition, for some developers, particularly those 
new to the platform, the new profile design may limit the visibility of 
their applications, affecting their ability to build a user base.<br><br>"The
redesign seems an overall step forward, but it will definitely have 
speed bumps from an actual implementation standpoint," said Tim 
O\'Shaughnessy, co-founder and CEO of Hungry Machine.<br><br>However, 
with the explosive growth in members and in applications on Facebook, 
the average member profile interface has become very cluttered, a 
situation that harms end-users and developers alike.<br><br>"Facebook is
a social [networking] operating system, and the profile is your entry 
point and your desktop. The utility of that [desktop] interface becomes 
less and less useful to the end-user as it gets more and more 
cluttered," said Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and CEO of Social Gaming 
Network (SGN). Thus, taking a bold step to clean up the member profile 
interface is a logical and natural enhancement for Facebook to make, he 
said.<br><br>Facebook has been talking about its redesign for a while, 
but this week provided concrete details about its plans, which are aimed
at retaining the layout\'s orderly and clean look, a differentiator from
competitors like MySpace.<br><br>At the heart of the redesign is the 
redistribution of profile content into different tabs so that users can 
better organize components such as the activity feed, photos, personal 
information, and applications. In addition, the activity feed tab will 
feature a new authoring control panel for creating and posting content 
called the Publisher Box. Moreover, the profile will have at the top a 
new horizontal navigation line with drop-down menus for its core 
features.<br><br>"The three main goals we have for this are: to make the
profiles simple and clean; to give users control; and to let them 
emphasize the most recent and relevant content. This is what we\'ve come 
up with as the best way to accomplish those goals," said Facebook\'s Mark
Slee, the product manager of the new design.<br><br>Of course, any user
interface change of this magnitude entails dangers, especially when it 
will affect about 70 million end-users and thousands of application 
developers. Facebook has experienced backlash from changes in the past, 
such as the initial versions of its activity feed feature and Beacon 
advertising program, both of which were criticized for being too 
intrusive on people\'s privacy.<br><br>"It\'s a pretty significant 
redesign, so users will definitely have an adjustment period," 
O\'Shaughnessy said. "People are generally opposed to change, so there\'ll
be a pretty reasonable amount of consternation from users just because 
it\'s different."<br><br>This is why O\'Shaughnessy has been surprised 
that Facebook is opting to roll out all the changes at once, as opposed 
to doing it more gradually, since the latter approach might lessen the 
impact on end-users. "It\'s always a risk to roll out a really big change
all at once," he said.<br><br>Yet, Slee is confident that the change 
won\'t be traumatic for end-users, since Facebook has been actively 
communicating the changes and plans via a Facebook group. Facebook also 
plans to have a time during which end-users will be able to toggle back 
and forth between the old and new layout, before the change is finalized
at some point in June, Slee said.<br><br>From the application developer
perspective, the redesign will also have significant effects, 
O\'Shaughnessy said. "The applications aren\'t present nearly as much as 
they were before," he said, alluding to the fact that the new design 
groups applications into a separate tab.<br><br>Although users will be 
able to create tabs for individual applications and the new top-level 
navigation includes a drop-down list of applications, "there\'s 
definitely the capability for apps to be less discoverable," 
O\'Shaughnessy said. "For newer developers especially, that\'ll be really 
hard."<br><br>Not that O\'Shaughnessy worries about being affected by 
this. Hungry Machine began launching its applications in mid-2007, 
shortly after Facebook opened its platform to external developers, and 
they have gained very good traction and popularity, and are generating a
healthy revenue stream.<br><br>However, Facebook argues that the new 
design will be good for developers, not only because applications can 
get their own tabs, but because users will be able to add application 
controls to the Publisher Box. "All applications will be able to tie 
right into that. We think that\'s a huge opportunity for developers," 
Slee said.<br><br>Meanwhile, having an entire tab devoted to 
applications will let developers "build a rich and deep experience that 
can take advantage of more space than has ever been provided in the 
profile," Slee said, adding that Facebook is opening a "sandbox" for 
developers to get acquainted with the profile changes.<br><br>Boris 
Silver, co-founder and CEO of Sport Interactiva, a developer of 
sport-themed games, also believes that end-users are likely to recoil at
first and that visibility for applications in general will be 
diminished, but believes the changes will ultimately be for the better, 
particularly for companies like his whose applications are firmly 
established on Facebook. "It\'ll give room to high-quality and useful 
applications that people value most to rise up," Silver said.<br><br>Pishevar
holds a similar view, saying that the changes will benefit applications
that are genuinely engaging and of high quality, and not those that try
to succeed via in-your-face, aggressive self-promotion tactics, 
something Facebook has been trying to discourage among developers.<br><br>"The
apps shouldn\'t be reliant on real estate on a profile page to thrive. 
There was tremendous benefits early on in the platform from having that 
real estate, but it also made it probably too easy to get users without 
actually investing real resources into making quality, highly engaging 
applications," Pishevar said.<br><br>Despite the possible bumps in the 
road, the developers interviewed agreed that, as far as the actual 
redesign is concerned, Facebook is hitting the right notes. "I\'m pretty 
high on the design itself. It\'s smoother, more efficient, more clear," 
O\'Shaughnessy said.<br>',

<div>


<span>NEW YORK - A $1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit 
challenging YouTube\'s ability to keep copyrighted material off its 
popular video-sharing site threatens how hundreds of millions of people 
exchange all kinds of information on the Internet, YouTube owner Google 
Inc. said.<br><br>Google\'s lawyers made the claim in papers filed in 
U.S. District Court in Manhattan as the company responded to Viacom 
Inc.\'s latest lawsuit alleging that the Internet has led to "an 
explosion of copyright infringement" by YouTube and others.<br><br>The 
back-and-forth between the companies has intensified since Viacom 
brought its lawsuit last year, saying it was owed damages for the 
unauthorized viewing of its programming from MTV, Comedy Central and 
other networks, including such hits as "The Daily Show with Jon 
Stewart."<br><br>In papers submitted to a judge late Friday, Google said
YouTube "goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content 
owners to protect their works."<br><br>It said that by seeking to make 
carriers and hosting providers liable for Internet communications, 
Viacom "threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately 
exchange information, news, entertainment and political and artistic 
expression."<br><br>Google said YouTube was faithful to the requirements
of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, saying the federal law 
was intended to protect companies like YouTube as long as they responded
properly to content owners\' claims of infringement.<br><br>On that score, Viacom says Google has set a terrible example.<br><br>In
a rewritten lawsuit filed last month, Viacom said YouTube consistently 
allows unauthorized copies of popular television programming and movies 
to be posted on its Web site and viewed tens of thousands of times.<br><br>Viacom
said it had identified more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of 
copyrighted programming â€” including "SpongeBob SquarePants," "South 
Park" and "MTV Unplugged" episodes and the documentary "An Inconvenient 
Truth" â€” that had been viewed "an astounding 1.5 billion times."<br><br>The
company said its count of unauthorized clips represents only a fraction
of the content on YouTube that violates its copyrights.<br><br>It said Google and YouTube had done "little or nothing" to stop infringement.<br><br>"To
the contrary, the availability on the YouTube site of a vast library of
the copyrighted works of plaintiffs and others is the cornerstone of 
defendants\' business plan," Viacom said.</span>

<span>LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - ABC.com is souping up its full-episode broadband player with new features for the fall.<br><br>Among
the bells and whistles set for the broadcaster\'s online destination are
full-screen viewing, closed captioning and the ability to send video 
links that can be embedded on blogs and social networks.<br><br>"Having 
come out of the gate with the first player in the space, we\'re 
continually looking at how we expand and provide a better experience 
from our users," said Alexis Rapo, vp digital media at ABC 
Entertainment.<br><br>ABC.com was the first full-episode player online 
when it launched in 2006, and as of April, it is the dominant one: Its 
8.9 million unique users was tops for the month among broadcasters, 
according to Nielsen Online. ABC.com also leads in minutes spent per 
user.<br><br>The user interface has been redesigned with new navigation 
and search features that allow users to comb series offerings 
graphically, alphabetically, by genre or popularity. Also added: content
recommendation technology that suggests programs based on a viewer\'s 
choices.<br><br>Although ABC.com previously contained the video to a 
browser window, the improved player will allow the image to take up the 
entire monitor. The viewer also will have the option of choosing from a 
variety of screen sizes, as well as picking standard or high definition.<br><br>Users
also can send links that can be posted elsewhere online, where they can
launch cued to a particular scene mid-episode. Video on ABC.com also 
will be more easy to sift through, with thumbnail images that offer a 
glimpse of the story line progression in each episode.<br><br>The new 
player will be tested in a closed beta over the summer before launching 
ahead of ABC\'s premiere week in the fall. ABC.com uses technology from 
Move Networks for its player.</span>

<span>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless said on Wednesday it 
joined a consortium working on a Linux-based mobile operating system 
expected to rival a mobile system being developed by a group headed by 
Google Inc (GOOG.O).<br><br>The announcement that the No. 2 U.S. mobile 
service joined the LiMo Foundation follows signals last month that 
AT&amp;T Inc (T.N) would support Android, the Linux operating system 
being developed by Google and about 30 partners.<br><br>Verizon 
Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone 
Group Plc (VOD.L), said it would take a seat on the foundation\'s board 
and expects to sell its first phones based on the LiMo operating system 
in 2009.<br><br>"We\'ll start with a few simpler devices and work our way
up," Verizon Wireless Network Vice President Kyle Malady said on a 
conference call with reporters.<br><br>Malady said that while Verizon 
would continue to support other operating systems such as that used in 
Research In Motion Ltd\'s (RIM.TO) BlackBerry, the LiMo system would be 
the company\'s operating system of choice.<br><br>Malady said the 
company, which is putting financial and personnel resources into the 
system, expects to eventually have an array of LiMo devices ranging from
the high end to the low end. He did not say how much Verizon was 
spending on developing the LiMo system.<br><br>He said the company is 
putting its weight behind LiMo rather than Android because of LiMo\'s 
inclusive governing structure as well as its diverse set of members. But
he would not rule out selling phones based on Android.<br><br>"If 
devices come along that are interesting to us and our customers we\'d 
absolutely look at that," said Malady, who also noted that third-parties
could sell Android devices to Verizon Wireless customers if they can 
work on its network.<br><br>The LiMo Foundation said it has about 40 
members including Verizon Wireless handset suppliers Samsung Electronics
Co Ltd (005930.KS) and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS). It said that 
Korea\'s SK Telecom Co Ltd (017670.KS) has also joined the consortium.</span>
